[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 20B, The First Punic War.
[00:12 --> 00:18] After years of inconclusive fighting on and around Sicily, the Romans decided the time
[00:18 --> 00:22] had finally come to stop fighting the tentacles of the Carthaginian Empire and stab right
[00:22 --> 00:23] at its heart.
[00:24 --> 00:28] They assembled a massive invasion fleet of 350 ships on the southern coast of
[00:28 --> 00:33] Sicily and in 256 BC set sail for Africa.
[00:34 --> 00:38] Though they were stalled by one of the largest naval battles in history, the Romans were
[00:38 --> 00:41] able to regroup and set out once again no worse for the wear.
[00:42 --> 00:47] They had been set back a few months, which threw a small monkey wrench into their plans,
[00:47 --> 00:51] but the Romans remained focused and confident that they were on their way to sack Carthage
[00:51 --> 00:52] and end the war.
[00:53 --> 00:58] In charge of the operation was the senior consul for the year, Marcus Attilius Regulus.
[01:00 --> 01:04] Originally, the plan in place had been to land about 50 miles southeast of Carthage,
[01:05 --> 01:09] disembark the legions, set up a defensive perimeter, and begin the march on the enemy
[01:09 --> 01:09] city.
[01:11 --> 01:14] The logic behind landing down the road from Carthage and not right on their
[01:14 --> 01:15] doorstep was twofold.
[01:16 --> 01:21] First, the waters immediately surrounding Carthage were patrolled by the weakened
[01:21 --> 01:23] but still powerful Carthaginian navy.
[01:24 --> 01:28] The Romans concluded that any resistance they faced at sea would be far stiffer than
[01:28 --> 01:29] any they met on land.
[01:30 --> 01:35] Second, the Romans had no illusions about the ease of taking a great city like Carthage,
[01:35 --> 01:39] so just as they had done with Syracuse, they knew they needed to isolate Carthage
[01:39 --> 01:41] and cut off its supply lines.
[01:42 --> 01:46] So, as the legions made their way to Carthage, they were supposed to convince locals along
[01:46 --> 01:50] the way that Carthage was doomed and it was time to join the Roman side.
[01:51 --> 01:55] Once the infantry reached Carthage, the bulk of the fleet would set up a blockade of the
[01:55 --> 02:00] city outside the reach of the Carthaginian navy, but still standing between Carthage
[02:00 --> 02:01] and its maritime supply routes.
[02:02 --> 02:06] It was a good plan, but the Battle of Aeknomus had set it all back a few months
[02:06 --> 02:10] and by the time the Romans finally landed in Africa, winter was fast approaching.
[02:11 --> 02:15] There was no way to provision the entire force, which included something like 75,000
[02:15 --> 02:20] rowers, so just like that, the carefully laid plan was tossed out and improvisation
[02:21 --> 02:21] commenced.
[02:22 --> 02:27] Most of the fleet was ordered back to Sicily, leaving Regulus in Africa with 15,000 infantry
[02:27 --> 02:28] and 500 cavalry.
[02:29 --> 02:33] His instructions were to hold the Roman position for the winter and do his level
[02:33 --> 02:37] best to begin the process of turning Carthage's allies against them.
[02:38 --> 02:42] Regulus though, had in mind for himself the glory of ending the war and decided
[02:42 --> 02:45] to march for Carthage anyway, with or without naval support.
[02:46 --> 02:51] He still understood the wisdom of isolating the Carthaginians though, and attacked Carthage's
[02:51 --> 02:52] North African allies along the way.
[02:54 --> 02:58] It was at one of these stops, about 40 miles from Carthage at the city of Aedes, that
[02:58 --> 03:01] the Romans met their first real resistance from the Carthaginian army.
[03:02 --> 03:07] However, afraid of meeting the Romans out on the plains, the Carthaginians took to
[03:07 --> 03:10] the hills where they figured the strength of the legions would be diminished.
[03:10 --> 03:14] This however was a disastrous strategy for two reasons.
[03:14 --> 03:19] First, the Romans had just spent 60 years locked in a mortal death struggle with the
[03:19 --> 03:22] Samnites and had learned every trick in the book when it came to hill fighting.
[03:23 --> 03:27] And second, the one true superiority of the Carthaginian ground forces was their
[03:27 --> 03:32] cavalry which, in the hills, were effectively taken out of the fight altogether.
[03:33 --> 03:37] So after the Carthaginian generals carefully set themselves up to fail, all that was
[03:37 --> 03:40] left to do was take the field and do just that.
[03:40 --> 03:44] The Romans marched up into the hills and dislodged the Carthaginians with ease,
[03:44 --> 03:45] driving them out of the area.
[03:46 --> 03:49] The city of Aedes then surrendered without further resistance.
[03:50 --> 03:53] The Carthaginian Senate was now beside itself.
[03:53 --> 03:57] Its army had been dispatched with ease and the Romans were on the move.
[03:58 --> 04:02] Adding to their despair, reports began to arrive that the fragile Carthaginian
[04:02 --> 04:06] domination of the Libyans and Numidians was breaking down and
[04:06 --> 04:07] revolts were flaring up.
[04:08 --> 04:11] The defection of the Numidians was particularly distressing.
[04:11 --> 04:15] In the whole of the Mediterranean, the Numidians were by far the best horsemen.
[04:16 --> 04:19] Without the Numidian cavalry riding with them, the one advantage the
[04:19 --> 04:21] Carthaginians did have would go out the window.
[04:23 --> 04:26] Cut off from their allies and without an army strong enough to oppose the
[04:26 --> 04:30] legions, the only option left to Carthage seemed to be negotiation.
[04:30 --> 04:34] The riding was on the wall and when the Romans finally did arrive at Carthage,
[04:34 --> 04:37] envoys, not an army, were sent to greet them.
[04:38 --> 04:42] Regulus agreed to meet with them and by all accounts was about to receive
[04:42 --> 04:45] significant concessions from the Carthaginians and bring an end to the
[04:45 --> 04:49] long war when fate, or rather ego, stepped in.
[04:50 --> 04:54] Intemperate in his demands, Regulus laid terms of surrender so preposterous
[04:54 --> 04:56] that the Carthaginians were forced to refuse.
[04:57 --> 05:01] He demanded the Carthaginians leave Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia
[05:01 --> 05:05] forever, that they completely dismantle their navy, pay a huge
[05:05 --> 05:09] punitive fine to Rome, and as a final humiliation, sign a treaty
[05:09 --> 05:12] that would place Carthage under the sovereignty of the Roman Senate.
[05:13 --> 05:16] The Carthaginian envoys were shocked.
[05:16 --> 05:19] Regulus was essentially acting as if he had defeated the Carthaginians
[05:19 --> 05:23] in battle and was imposing terms rather than bargaining with a weak
[05:23 --> 05:24] but still unconquered city.
[05:25 --> 05:29] The Carthaginians were better off rejecting the terms and praying for a
[05:29 --> 05:32] miracle than just giving away the farm without making the Romans even
[05:32 --> 05:34] work for it.
[05:34 --> 05:37] So the envoys returned to Carthage and announced that they had failed
[05:37 --> 05:40] to give up, which is pretty hard to do when you think about it.
[05:42 --> 05:44] But all was not completely lost for the Carthaginians.
[05:45 --> 05:48] They had sent out feelers across the Mediterranean looking for aid
[05:48 --> 05:52] and had hit upon a good lead in Greece, specifically in the
[05:52 --> 05:54] legendarily martial city of Sparta.
[05:55 --> 05:58] At the same time the negotiations were underway with Regulus,
[05:58 --> 06:02] word came that a Spartan general with a small but lethal force of Greek
[06:02 --> 06:03] mercenaries were on their way.
[06:04 --> 06:07] The Carthaginian Senate hoped that this army from the east would turn out
[06:07 --> 06:09] to be the miracle they had prayed for.
[06:10 --> 06:13] So as Regulus settled in for the winter and dreamed of the triumph he
[06:13 --> 06:16] would receive when the Carthaginians finally came to their senses,
[06:17 --> 06:20] the Greek army arrived and though Regulus did not realize it yet,
[06:20 --> 06:22] kicked glory out of his reach.
[06:24 --> 06:28] The Spartan general, Xanthippus, set to work immediately by interviewing
[06:28 --> 06:30] Carthaginian soldiers present at the Battle of Aedes.
[06:31 --> 06:35] He was shocked to hear how badly the Carthaginian generals had mucked
[06:35 --> 06:38] things up and concluded quickly that there was nothing wrong with
[06:38 --> 06:40] the Carthaginian army itself, just its leadership.
[06:41 --> 06:45] He was further convinced when he was tasked by the Carthaginian
[06:45 --> 06:47] Senate with drilling their army into shape.
[06:47 --> 06:50] As he watched them, he realized there was nothing wrong with the
[06:50 --> 06:54] infantry, the cavalry was magnificent and the war elephants
[06:54 --> 06:55] practically indestructible.
[06:56 --> 06:58] He reported to the Senate that they had nothing to fear from the
[06:58 --> 07:02] Romans and as soon as spring came, advised them to immediately
[07:02 --> 07:04] challenge the legions in the open plains.
[07:05 --> 07:08] The Senate was skeptical, but Xanthippus eventually moved them
[07:08 --> 07:09] to order the attack.
[07:11 --> 07:13] When spring did arrive and no treaty had been reached,
[07:14 --> 07:15] Regulus began to get fidgety.
[07:16 --> 07:19] When the Roman fleet returned to North Africa, they were sure
[07:19 --> 07:21] to bring the new consuls for the year with them.
[07:22 --> 07:26] Regulus had won the Battle of Aknamis, landed in North Africa
[07:26 --> 07:27] and marched to the gates of Carthage.
[07:28 --> 07:31] Now, with victory in his grasp, he was about to have to
[07:31 --> 07:34] hand the baton off in the final 50 yards of the marathon
[07:34 --> 07:37] and let some newbie cross the finish line and get all the
[07:37 --> 07:37] glory.
[07:38 --> 07:41] The clock was ticking, not on Rome's chances in North
[07:41 --> 07:44] Africa, but on Regulus's chance to be the center of
[07:44 --> 07:45] attention at the victory party.
[07:47 --> 07:50] When the newly confident Carthaginian army marched out
[07:50 --> 07:52] into the plains beside Carthage, was
[07:52 --> 07:55] Xanthippus at its head, Regulus would have been wise
[07:55 --> 07:58] to stall for time and wait for reinforcements from Rome
[07:58 --> 07:59] to guarantee victory.
[08:00 --> 08:02] His army was not large and had just spent the winter in
[08:02 --> 08:06] enemy territory, but blinded by vanity, he jumped
[08:06 --> 08:07] at the chance to fight.
[08:08 --> 08:10] Conventional wisdom was that the Carthaginians were
[08:10 --> 08:13] no match for the legions out in the open, and when
[08:13 --> 08:16] Regulus saw them march out, his head was filled with
[08:16 --> 08:18] visions of dining in Carthage that very night,
[08:18 --> 08:21] which, of course, he did, just not in the way he
[08:21 --> 08:22] imagined.
[08:23 --> 08:26] The battle, to say the least, was an unmitigated
[08:26 --> 08:27] disaster for Rome.
[08:28 --> 08:30] Xanthippus saw clearly the advantage his superior
[08:30 --> 08:33] cavalry afforded him, and Regulus's infantry
[08:33 --> 08:35] deployment all but guaranteed Carthaginian
[08:35 --> 08:37] victory before the battle even began.
[08:38 --> 08:41] Xanthippus placed the war elephant at the head of
[08:41 --> 08:43] his army and the cavalry on the wings.
[08:43 --> 08:46] Regulus responded by deepening his line so the
[08:46 --> 08:48] elephants could not break through them completely,
[08:48 --> 08:51] but in order to do so, he had to sacrifice the width
[08:51 --> 08:52] of his front.
[08:53 --> 08:55] He essentially flipped the rettkangle that was his
[08:55 --> 08:57] army so that the short end, rather than the
[08:57 --> 08:59] broad side, were facing the Carthaginians.
[09:01 --> 09:03] When Xanthippus saw Regulus order the new
[09:03 --> 09:05] deployment, he knew victory was in his grasp.
[09:06 --> 09:08] With the short in front, the Romans would be
[09:08 --> 09:10] easily outflanked by the Carthaginian cavalry.
[09:11 --> 09:13] Regulus couldn't have played into Xanthippus's
[09:13 --> 09:15] hands more if he had tried.
[09:17 --> 09:19] The battle began when Xanthippus sent the elephants
[09:19 --> 09:22] in, who duly caused their patented brand of havoc.
[09:23 --> 09:25] While the Romans were focused on the giant
[09:25 --> 09:27] beasts, he ordered out the cavalry, which rooted
[09:27 --> 09:29] their Roman counterparts easily.
[09:30 --> 09:31] And just as the Romans were getting a handle on
[09:31 --> 09:34] the elephants, they were hit from both sides by
[09:34 --> 09:35] the Carthaginian cavalry.
[09:36 --> 09:39] The Romans, now besieged from all fronts, fought
[09:39 --> 09:41] for their lives, surging forward in an attempt
[09:41 --> 09:43] to break out of the cavalry pincher.
[09:44 --> 09:47] But waiting for them was the fresh and so far
[09:47 --> 09:48] unused Carthaginian infantry.
[09:50 --> 09:52] The exhausted Romans didn't stand a chance.
[09:52 --> 09:54] Of the 15,000 or so who entered the battle,
[09:55 --> 09:56] only 2,000 made it out alive.
[09:57 --> 10:00] Of these, around 500 were taken prisoner,
[10:00 --> 10:03] including Regulus himself, who, as I said,
[10:03 --> 10:05] did indeed dine in Carthage that very evening,
[10:06 --> 10:07] his hands hobbled by chains.
[10:09 --> 10:11] When the Roman fleet finally arrived,
[10:11 --> 10:14] it was not to preside over a final victory for Rome,
[10:14 --> 10:16] but rather to pick up the pitiful survivors
[10:16 --> 10:17] of a devastated army.
[10:19 --> 10:21] The Roman adventure in North Africa was over,
[10:21 --> 10:22] and it would be 50 years before they would
[10:22 --> 10:24] attempt anything so audacious again.
[10:26 --> 10:28] That time, though, young Scipio Africanus
[10:28 --> 10:30] would lead the invasion and secure a much
[10:30 --> 10:31] better result.
[10:32 --> 10:34] To add insult to injury, when the Roman ships
[10:34 --> 10:37] were returning from North Africa, a storm
[10:37 --> 10:39] kicked up and sank the entire fleet.
[10:39 --> 10:42] It was one of the worst maritime disasters
[10:42 --> 10:42] in history.
[10:43 --> 10:45] 100,000 men drowned, just like that.
[10:46 --> 10:48] After news of the disaster reached Rome,
[10:48 --> 10:50] the Senate took stock of the situation
[10:50 --> 10:52] and realized that after 10 years of fighting,
[10:52 --> 10:54] they were right back at square one.
[10:56 --> 10:58] Xanthippus, clearly the best thing to ever happen
[10:58 --> 11:01] to Carthage, was rewarded for his victory
[11:01 --> 11:03] with public acclaim and private threats.
[11:04 --> 11:06] The Carthaginian nobility was threatened
[11:06 --> 11:08] by the brilliant Greek tactician,
[11:08 --> 11:10] and it was not long before Xanthippus,
[11:10 --> 11:12] fearing he would be assassinated
[11:12 --> 11:13] by the jealous nobility if he remained
[11:13 --> 11:16] in Carthage, left the city for good.
[11:16 --> 11:18] The loss of so great a commander did nothing
[11:18 --> 11:20] to help the Carthaginian war effort.
[11:21 --> 11:22] It was one of the great blunders of the war
[11:22 --> 11:25] that the nobility let their own paranoia
[11:25 --> 11:27] take precedence over actually winning the fight.
[11:28 --> 11:29] Xanthippus could have done great things
[11:29 --> 11:32] for them, but he was never given a chance.
[11:33 --> 11:35] The war now returned to Sicily.
[11:36 --> 11:39] The Romans, with their seemingly bottomless reserves
[11:39 --> 11:41] of men and money, enlisted tens of thousands
[11:41 --> 11:44] of new soldiers and sent them off to continue the fight.
[11:45 --> 11:47] Just as had happened before though,
[11:47 --> 11:49] years of inconclusive fighting followed,
[11:49 --> 11:51] and it led the Romans to conclude
[11:51 --> 11:53] that they had to do something drastic
[11:53 --> 11:55] to bring this interminable conflict to an end.
[11:56 --> 11:57] The decision was made to attack
[11:57 --> 11:59] the Carthaginian stronghold of Lillebom
[11:59 --> 12:01] on the northwest coast of the island.
[12:03 --> 12:04] A victory there would mean the end
[12:04 --> 12:06] of a Carthaginian presence on Sicily,
[12:07 --> 12:09] and the Romans prepared for the attack
[12:09 --> 12:11] with all the energy and skill they could muster.
[12:12 --> 12:14] They built a fleet of about 80 ships
[12:14 --> 12:15] to blockade Lillebom's harbor
[12:15 --> 12:17] and ordered the bulk of their land forces
[12:17 --> 12:20] to the city with instructions to bring it to its knees.
[12:21 --> 12:24] But despite the massive investment of time
[12:24 --> 12:27] and money into siege equipment and provisions,
[12:27 --> 12:29] the Carthaginians simply would not be moved.
[12:30 --> 12:32] They had little trouble running the blockade,
[12:32 --> 12:33] which the inexperienced Romans
[12:33 --> 12:35] did a poor job of maintaining,
[12:35 --> 12:37] and they kept themselves well supplied.
[12:38 --> 12:41] In 249 BC, after about a year of getting nowhere,
[12:42 --> 12:43] new consuls arrived at Lillebom,
[12:44 --> 12:46] and one of them, Publius Claudius Pulcher,
[12:46 --> 12:48] brought with him a bold plan.
[12:49 --> 12:51] He gathered the military tribunes together
[12:51 --> 12:52] and made his pitch.
[12:53 --> 12:54] The Carthaginian fleet,
[12:54 --> 12:56] which was anchored not far down the coast
[12:56 --> 12:57] at a city called Drapana,
[12:58 --> 13:01] believed the Romans were set on maintaining the blockade
[13:01 --> 13:02] and posed no real threat.
[13:03 --> 13:05] If the Romans sailed their 120 odd ships
[13:05 --> 13:07] down the coast at night,
[13:07 --> 13:09] they could surprise the Carthaginians
[13:09 --> 13:11] and destroy their navy before they knew what hit them.
[13:12 --> 13:14] Their ability to run the blockade crippled.
[13:14 --> 13:17] It would only be a matter of time before Lillebom fell.
[13:18 --> 13:21] With the eloquent certainty of a true Claudii,
[13:21 --> 13:22] Pulcher won over the troops
[13:22 --> 13:24] and preparations for the raid began immediately.
[13:26 --> 13:29] However, Pulcher made one huge mistake
[13:29 --> 13:30] at the outset of the operation
[13:30 --> 13:31] that sealed his fate
[13:31 --> 13:33] and secured his place in Roman history
[13:33 --> 13:35] not as a great hero,
[13:35 --> 13:37] but one of its greatest goats.
[13:38 --> 13:39] Setting out for Drapana,
[13:39 --> 13:41] he ordered that the auspices be taken
[13:41 --> 13:43] and the sacred chickens consulted.
[13:44 --> 13:46] In the great litany of Roman superstition,
[13:47 --> 13:48] consulting with the sacred chickens
[13:48 --> 13:50] has always been my personal favorite.
[13:51 --> 13:53] A flock of chickens were always carried around
[13:53 --> 13:53] with the army,
[13:53 --> 13:55] and just before a battle,
[13:55 --> 13:57] an auger would scatter feed in front of them.
[13:58 --> 13:59] If the sacred chickens ate,
[13:59 --> 14:01] it meant victory was assured.
[14:01 --> 14:02] But if they did not,
[14:02 --> 14:04] the prudent commander held up his attack
[14:04 --> 14:05] for another day.
[14:06 --> 14:06] Pulcher, however,
[14:07 --> 14:09] had no time for such ridiculous piety,
[14:09 --> 14:11] and when the sacred chickens refused to eat,
[14:11 --> 14:13] he ordered them thrown overboard,
[14:13 --> 14:14] saying famously,
[14:14 --> 14:15] if they're not hungry,
[14:15 --> 14:16] maybe they're thirsty.
[14:17 --> 14:18] He sailed off into battle,
[14:19 --> 14:20] though how he expected to win
[14:20 --> 14:22] without the approval of the sacred chickens
[14:22 --> 14:23] is a mystery.
[14:25 --> 14:26] The debacle that followed
[14:26 --> 14:28] left the Carthaginians stronger than ever.
[14:28 --> 14:30] Pulcher's fleet got started late
[14:30 --> 14:32] and was noticed by Carthaginian lookouts
[14:32 --> 14:34] before they were within striking distance.
[14:35 --> 14:37] They immediately responded by outmaneuvering
[14:37 --> 14:39] and trapping Pulcher's fleet against the coast,
[14:40 --> 14:41] where they were smashed against the rocks.
[14:42 --> 14:45] Of the 120 Roman ships that set sail,
[14:45 --> 14:46] only 30 returned.
[14:47 --> 14:48] The dream of taking Lillebom
[14:48 --> 14:50] had now passed into complete fantasy.
[14:52 --> 14:53] The other consul for the year
[14:53 --> 14:55] attempted to reprovision the Roman troops
[14:55 --> 14:56] left at Lillebom
[14:56 --> 14:58] by sailing around the south end of the island,
[14:58 --> 15:00] but lost all his ships in yet another storm.
[15:01 --> 15:03] He himself managed to survive
[15:03 --> 15:04] and make his way to Lillebom,
[15:04 --> 15:07] where he declared an end to the siege and withdrew.
[15:08 --> 15:11] When the First Punic War finally ended eight years later,
[15:11 --> 15:13] Lillebom remained unconquered.
[15:14 --> 15:16] But the Romans were not done yet.
[15:17 --> 15:19] They withdrew their troops to Mount Erex,
[15:19 --> 15:21] a mountain in the west center of the island.
[15:21 --> 15:23] By taking the strategic high ground,
[15:23 --> 15:26] they were able to bottle up the Carthaginian land forces
[15:26 --> 15:29] in their two garrisons, Lillebom and Drapana.
[15:30 --> 15:32] The war had now come full circle.
[15:32 --> 15:33] The Romans controlled the land
[15:33 --> 15:35] and the Carthaginians the sea.
[15:35 --> 15:37] Neither was strong enough to beat the other
[15:37 --> 15:39] in their respective sphere of dominance,
[15:39 --> 15:41] and a new stalemate commenced.
[15:42 --> 15:44] By this time though,
[15:44 --> 15:46] both sides were broke and short of manpower
[15:46 --> 15:47] and facing problems elsewhere.
[15:48 --> 15:51] The Gauls were stirring on Rome's northern frontier
[15:51 --> 15:54] and North Africa was in revolt against Carthaginian rule.
[15:55 --> 15:57] The enemies of Rome and Carthage seemed to have finally noticed
[15:57 --> 15:59] that the two combatants were beating each other
[15:59 --> 16:01] into a state of exhaustion in Sicily
[16:01 --> 16:03] and set about trying to exploit the situation.
[16:05 --> 16:07] So for the next seven years,
[16:07 --> 16:10] Sicily became a neglected backwater war zone.
[16:11 --> 16:12] The Carthaginians,
[16:12 --> 16:15] under the command of a new general, Hamilcar Baracca,
[16:15 --> 16:17] was reduced to running a guerrilla war
[16:17 --> 16:18] and hoping that the Romans
[16:18 --> 16:20] would just quit the island out of frustration.
[16:21 --> 16:23] The center of the action was at Mount Erex,
[16:24 --> 16:26] where the strongest Roman garrison was stationed
[16:26 --> 16:28] and where Hamilcar directed the majority of his attacks.
[16:30 --> 16:33] In 244 BC, Hamilcar finally managed to drive the Romans
[16:33 --> 16:35] out and hold the high ground for himself.
[16:36 --> 16:37] For the next three years,
[16:38 --> 16:39] he would use the mountain as a base
[16:39 --> 16:41] while he prosecuted his asymmetrical war
[16:41 --> 16:42] against the Romans,
[16:43 --> 16:45] under man and under supplied by the Carthaginian Senate,
[16:46 --> 16:48] who, after a political party shift,
[16:48 --> 16:50] had lost all interest in the war against Rome.
[16:52 --> 16:55] Seeing Carthaginian interest at an all-time low,
[16:55 --> 16:57] the Romans decided to make their final,
[16:57 --> 16:58] final push to win the war.
[17:00 --> 17:02] After failing first in North Africa and then at Lillebom,
[17:03 --> 17:05] the Romans, eternal optimists that they were,
[17:06 --> 17:08] decided that the time for victory had finally come.
[17:09 --> 17:11] They built a new, new fleet,
[17:11 --> 17:12] starting a navy from scratch
[17:12 --> 17:14] for the fourth time of the war.
[17:15 --> 17:17] The Carthaginian fleet had been removed from Sicily
[17:17 --> 17:19] after the disappearance of Rome from the seas
[17:19 --> 17:20] a few years earlier,
[17:21 --> 17:22] and there was nothing standing in the way of the Romans
[17:22 --> 17:25] as they once again blockaded Lillebom and Drapana,
[17:26 --> 17:28] the last two Carthaginian outposts on the island.
[17:30 --> 17:31] This time, the blockades worked
[17:31 --> 17:33] and the garrisons were slowly starved out.
[17:34 --> 17:36] The Carthaginians suddenly became interested
[17:36 --> 17:39] in Sicily again and launched their entire fleet
[17:39 --> 17:40] to drive the Romans off.
[17:41 --> 17:42] But the hastily mustered crews
[17:42 --> 17:45] were this time less experienced than the Romans,
[17:45 --> 17:47] who had been at sea for some time.
[17:48 --> 17:50] Around the northwest coast of Sicily,
[17:50 --> 17:52] the last battle of the war was fought,
[17:52 --> 17:55] the Romans decisively routing the Carthaginian navy.
[17:56 --> 17:57] The garrison's about to fall
[17:57 --> 18:00] and with no way of keeping himself provisioned,
[18:00 --> 18:02] Hamilcar reluctantly opened negotiations
[18:02 --> 18:03] with the Romans.
[18:04 --> 18:05] The final treaty,
[18:06 --> 18:08] hammered out by Hamilcar and his Roman counterpart,
[18:08 --> 18:10] read, there shall be peace
[18:10 --> 18:12] between the Carthaginians and the Romans,
[18:13 --> 18:14] subject to the approval by the Roman people
[18:14 --> 18:16] upon these conditions.
[18:17 --> 18:19] The Carthaginians shall relinquish every part of Sicily.
[18:20 --> 18:21] They are not to make war against Cairo
[18:21 --> 18:24] nor do anything to disturb the Syracusans
[18:24 --> 18:25] or their allies.
[18:26 --> 18:28] All the Roman prisoners will be returned without ransom
[18:28 --> 18:31] and a tribute of 200 talents of silver
[18:31 --> 18:32] paid within 20 years.
[18:34 --> 18:35] Returning to Carthage,
[18:36 --> 18:37] Hamilcar immediately began to look elsewhere
[18:37 --> 18:40] for an opportunity to make up for Carthage's loss
[18:40 --> 18:42] of Sicily and set his sights on Spain.
[18:43 --> 18:45] He did not forget the humiliation
[18:45 --> 18:47] of having to abandon Mount Erex, however,
[18:47 --> 18:49] and as he sailed north with his eldest son,
[18:49 --> 18:50] Hannibal, in tow,
[18:50 --> 18:52] he made the nine-year-old boy swear an oath
[18:52 --> 18:54] of eternal hatred for the Romans,
[18:55 --> 18:55] which the boy did.
[18:56 --> 18:58] It was an oath Hannibal never forgot
[18:58 --> 19:00] and he would dedicate his entire life
[19:00 --> 19:01] to the destruction of the Romans,
[19:02 --> 19:03] the mortal enemy of his family.
[19:06 --> 19:07] The First Punic War was now over
[19:07 --> 19:09] and Rome was the clear victor.
[19:10 --> 19:11] However, the peace settlement
[19:11 --> 19:13] did not address the larger issues
[19:13 --> 19:15] still facing the two strongest empires
[19:15 --> 19:16] in the western Mediterranean.
[19:18 --> 19:20] Yes, Rome had won control of Sicily
[19:20 --> 19:22] and the Carthaginians had been forced to retreat,
[19:22 --> 19:24] but the North Africans were undeterred
[19:24 --> 19:26] in their quest for territorial expansion.
[19:27 --> 19:29] The First Punic War settled the issue
[19:29 --> 19:30] of who controlled the island of Sicily,
[19:31 --> 19:33] but did nothing to settle the larger issues
[19:33 --> 19:34] of who controlled the greater Mediterranean.
[19:35 --> 19:37] In that larger game,
[19:37 --> 19:39] the Carthaginians still obviously felt confident
[19:39 --> 19:40] that they could win.
[19:41 --> 19:44] The First Punic War, as I said last week,
[19:44 --> 19:46] was marked by poor judgment on both sides
[19:46 --> 19:49] and ironically, it was the victorious Romans
[19:49 --> 19:51] who seemed to make more boneheaded moves
[19:51 --> 19:53] than the defeated Carthaginians.
[19:54 --> 19:56] Regulus blew an opportunity to end the war
[19:56 --> 19:58] and because he let his ego get in the way,
[19:59 --> 20:00] the conflict dragged on 10 years longer
[20:00 --> 20:01] than it should have.
[20:02 --> 20:04] The neophyte Roman sailors
[20:04 --> 20:06] managed to lose two entire fleets to storms,
[20:07 --> 20:09] storms they were warned about in advance, by the way,
[20:10 --> 20:12] and another to Claudius Poulcher's botched midnight raid.
[20:13 --> 20:15] If it had been anyone else,
[20:15 --> 20:17] each of these disasters by themselves
[20:17 --> 20:19] would have been enough to shut down the war,
[20:19 --> 20:21] but the Romans were able to absorb the losses
[20:21 --> 20:23] and it was their deep pockets
[20:23 --> 20:24] more than battlefield skill,
[20:25 --> 20:26] which they rode to victory.
[20:27 --> 20:29] The Carthaginians, for their part,
[20:30 --> 20:31] found themselves succumbing as much
[20:31 --> 20:34] to the reputation of the Romans as anything else.
[20:35 --> 20:37] Despite the fact that Xanthippus clearly demonstrated
[20:37 --> 20:39] that the Romans could be beaten on land,
[20:39 --> 20:41] the Carthaginians were reluctant
[20:41 --> 20:42] to invest in their land forces.
[20:44 --> 20:45] After the last of their fleet
[20:45 --> 20:47] was dashed on the rocks in 248 BC,
[20:48 --> 20:50] the Romans essentially ceded the water to Carthage.
[20:51 --> 20:53] But with one theater of the war now shut down,
[20:54 --> 20:56] the Carthaginians failed to capitalize on it
[20:56 --> 20:58] and divert resources to the other theater
[20:58 --> 21:00] and left Hamilcar to run a guerrilla war
[21:00 --> 21:02] on a shoestring budget,
[21:02 --> 21:04] rather than give him men and money
[21:04 --> 21:06] to prosecute a real ground attack.
[21:07 --> 21:08] The winner of the first Punic War
[21:08 --> 21:10] was always going to be the side
[21:10 --> 21:12] that succeeded on the other team's field.
[21:13 --> 21:14] So it went to the Romans,
[21:14 --> 21:16] who finally raised one last navy.
[21:17 --> 21:19] If the Carthaginians had sucked it up
[21:19 --> 21:20] and done the same thing,
[21:21 --> 21:23] only building an army rather than a navy,
[21:23 --> 21:25] they may have succeeded in pushing
[21:25 --> 21:27] the war-weary Romans off the island.
[21:28 --> 21:30] It would have been an interesting historical turn
[21:30 --> 21:31] had that occurred.
[21:32 --> 21:34] The war marked the first time Rome fought outside of Italy
[21:34 --> 21:36] and had they lost,
[21:36 --> 21:38] overseas fighting may have left
[21:38 --> 21:39] a bad enough taste in their mouth
[21:39 --> 21:41] that they would have contented themselves
[21:41 --> 21:43] with merely an Italian empire.
[21:44 --> 21:45] As it stood now, however,
[21:46 --> 21:47] Rome's first overseas adventure
[21:47 --> 21:49] had left them with a rich new province
[21:49 --> 21:52] and it merely whetted their appetite for more.
[21:54 --> 21:56] Next week, we will cover the years
[21:56 --> 21:58] between the first and second Punic Wars.
[21:59 --> 22:01] Rome would face a Gallic army
[22:01 --> 22:02] pressing down from the north
[22:02 --> 22:05] and also make their first foray east,
[22:05 --> 22:07] landing an army on the far side of the Adriatic.
[22:08 --> 22:09] All the while,
[22:10 --> 22:12] Carthage was consolidating its holdings in Spain.
[22:13 --> 22:15] Both sides knew the peace between them
[22:15 --> 22:16] could not last forever.
[22:16 --> 22:17] It was only a matter of time
[22:17 --> 22:20] before hostilities between the two great powers resumed.
[22:21 --> 22:24] In 218 BC, the peace would finally break
[22:24 --> 22:27] and Hannibal Baraka would make good on his oath,
[22:27 --> 22:29] descend into Italy and wreak havoc
[22:29 --> 22:31] not just in the Roman countryside
[22:31 --> 22:32] but in the Roman mine.

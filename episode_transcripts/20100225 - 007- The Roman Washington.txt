[00:03 --> 00:06] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:15] We ended last week in 451 BC with the 12 Tables of Law written down and the December had expelled.
[00:16 --> 00:21] This week I want to step back a few years to focus on the life of one man, Lucius Quintius
[00:21 --> 00:26] Cincinnati, who was passed into the collective memory as a paradigm of Republican virtue,
[00:27 --> 00:31] though the decisive moments of his life were almost certainly invented by later historians
[00:31 --> 00:37] to embellish his famous career, and, in the end, nothing he did was particularly unprecedented.
[00:37 --> 00:42] Still, his biography continues to resonate, and taken by itself, it is a pretty good
[00:42 --> 00:47] story of a humble man who had absolute power thrust upon him, and then, remarkably,
[00:47 --> 00:50] relinquished that power and returned to his plow.
[00:50 --> 00:53] A man who sacrificed everything for the Republic.
[00:55 --> 01:00] Cincinnati was born around 519 BC, when the king still reigned, and was just a boy when
[01:00 --> 01:02] Brutus and Colatinus expelled the Tarquins.
[01:03 --> 01:07] He was therefore one of the first citizens in Rome who lived his entire life under
[01:07 --> 01:10] a Republican government, without strong memories of the monarchy.
[01:11 --> 01:13] He was in the vanguard of a critical generation.
[01:14 --> 01:18] His elders remembered vividly the tyranny of Tarquin, and their steadfast Republican
[01:18 --> 01:22] principles reflect a personally developed hatred of monarchy.
[01:22 --> 01:26] They were the victims, and would do anything to avoid being victims again.
[01:26 --> 01:32] Cincinnati, however, and those of his generation, never personally experienced this victimization.
[01:32 --> 01:36] Once they came of age, the Republic would have to sink or swim on its own merit.
[01:37 --> 01:40] If a would-be tyrant began to acquire too much power, there would be no one to
[01:40 --> 01:43] turn to and say, hey, remember Tarquin?
[01:43 --> 01:46] This guy's trying to be another Tarquin, because there would be no one left who
[01:46 --> 01:47] actually remembered Tarquin.
[01:48 --> 01:52] It is in this passing from living memory that mistakes of history repeat themselves.
[01:53 --> 01:57] Ambitious men of later generations might attempt to seize power, and, believing
[01:57 --> 02:01] their times to be unique, a cowering population might allow it.
[02:01 --> 02:05] In those times, only vigilance born of a love of Republic, not a hatred of
[02:05 --> 02:10] monarchy, would save the people from slavery, and Cincinnati was amongst the
[02:10 --> 02:13] first to set down that love of the Republic for its own sake.
[02:14 --> 02:19] To dispel one myth straight away, Cincinnati was at no point a defender of the little
[02:19 --> 02:20] guy.
[02:20 --> 02:24] He was a patrician by birth and upbringing, and when he emerged on the
[02:24 --> 02:28] public stage, it was as a steadfast opponent of the tribunes and their reforms.
[02:29 --> 02:33] His first appearance in the historical record is not a starring role, but rather a
[02:33 --> 02:35] supporting part in the drama of his son, Queso.
[02:36 --> 02:39] There is a great deal of civil unrest in the aftermath of Tarantillus's
[02:39 --> 02:43] proposal to codify the law, and plebe demonstrations in the forum were often
[02:43 --> 02:48] broken up by collections, or gangs, if you prefer, of young patrician nobles.
[02:49 --> 02:53] Queso, an abnormally large young man, took to this with great relish,
[02:53 --> 02:56] personally beating and chasing any plebe who tried to take part in such
[02:56 --> 02:57] demonstrations.
[02:58 --> 03:01] Young and hot-tempered that he was, though, he was easy pickings for a
[03:01 --> 03:05] savvy tribune named Virginius, who intentionally goaded Queso by leading
[03:06 --> 03:09] public marches that would inevitably draw the wrath of the young man.
[03:10 --> 03:14] Once he had enough witnesses and evidence, Virginius brought capital charges
[03:14 --> 03:18] against Queso for, well, all the horrible things he had done.
[03:18 --> 03:22] Queso was ordered to appear at a trial, and if he did not, then he would
[03:22 --> 03:23] be fined a large sum of money.
[03:24 --> 03:27] It is at this point that Cincinnati makes his first appearance in the
[03:27 --> 03:30] public record, defending his son against Virginius's accusations and
[03:30 --> 03:32] asking that the charges be dropped.
[03:32 --> 03:37] Rather than face an obviously hostile and biased court, Queso fled north
[03:37 --> 03:39] to Atruria and out of the history of Rome completely.
[03:40 --> 03:44] His son having essentially jumped bail, Cincinnati was forced to sell
[03:44 --> 03:47] most of his properties to pay the debt, leaving him a pauper with
[03:47 --> 03:49] only a small plot of land on the far side of the Tiber.
[03:51 --> 03:54] It is from this impoverished state that Cincinnati's own legend begins.
[03:55 --> 03:59] In 460 BC, not long after the Sabines had been expelled from the
[03:59 --> 04:02] Citadel, Cincinnati was chosen to serve as one of the two consuls
[04:02 --> 04:03] for that year.
[04:04 --> 04:06] The tribunes were less than thrilled at this development,
[04:06 --> 04:09] recognizing that they had just put the screws to this old man
[04:09 --> 04:12] because they were angry with his son, and now he was in a position
[04:12 --> 04:13] of authority over them.
[04:14 --> 04:17] Cincinnati did nothing to ease their minds, immediately attacking
[04:17 --> 04:20] the character of the plebe leadership, who he accused of aiding
[04:20 --> 04:23] and abetting the Sabine capture of the Citadel with their
[04:23 --> 04:24] selfish myopia.
[04:25 --> 04:26] This set the tone for the year.
[04:27 --> 04:30] Struggles ensued between the consuls on the one hand, the tribunes
[04:30 --> 04:34] on the other, with the Senate and popular assemblies caught in between.
[04:35 --> 04:37] Cincinnati managed to kill Tarantellus' bill for the year,
[04:38 --> 04:41] while the tribunes banned the consuls from taking any army
[04:41 --> 04:43] more than one mile outside the city limits.
[04:44 --> 04:46] By the end of the year, no compromise was reached, and the
[04:46 --> 04:49] battle was set to continue on into the next year, but the
[04:49 --> 04:52] Senate passed a law stating that no magistrate, patrician,
[04:52 --> 04:54] or plebe could serve in successive years.
[04:55 --> 04:58] The tribunes dismissed this out of hat and had themselves
[04:58 --> 05:00] re-elected, so the patricians were set to reconfirm
[05:01 --> 05:03] Cincinnati's when he announced that if they were to act no
[05:03 --> 05:06] better than the plebes, then they were no better than the
[05:06 --> 05:08] plebes, and refused to stand for office.
[05:09 --> 05:12] Agreeing reluctantly to this logic, the patricians allowed
[05:12 --> 05:14] Cincinnati's to retire to a small farm.
[05:15 --> 05:17] It would not be long, however, before he was called back
[05:17 --> 05:20] to service in his most famous role, dictator of Rome.
[05:22 --> 05:25] In 458, the Aequians had been causing Rome trouble, and one
[05:25 --> 05:27] of the consuls for the year was sent with an army to deal
[05:27 --> 05:28] with them.
[05:28 --> 05:30] However, the fight was much rougher than it had been in
[05:30 --> 05:33] the past, and the legions found themselves pinned down,
[05:33 --> 05:36] unable to retreat, and facing annihilation.
[05:37 --> 05:39] The citizens of Rome panicked and, without descent,
[05:39 --> 05:42] a dictator was called for, and Cincinnati was named.
[05:43 --> 05:45] A delegation was sent to inform the old man, and
[05:45 --> 05:48] famously found him at work on the small farm he had
[05:48 --> 05:51] retired to, a living paradigm of Roman virtue.
[05:52 --> 05:54] The delegation saluted Cincinnati's dictator,
[05:54 --> 05:57] imploring him to return to the city at once.
[05:57 --> 05:59] The tribunes were appalled to see their old political
[05:59 --> 06:02] enemy return to such a powerful position, but Cincinnati
[06:02 --> 06:05] was greeted in the city with such a claim that there was
[06:05 --> 06:07] little they could do but hope that the old patrician
[06:07 --> 06:10] would not turn his absolute power against them.
[06:11 --> 06:13] Cincinnati, however, was not out to settle political
[06:13 --> 06:17] grudges, well, not yet anyway, and promptly raised an
[06:17 --> 06:19] army and marched to the rescue of the besieged legion.
[06:20 --> 06:23] Wasting no time, Cincinnati's army swept in and
[06:23 --> 06:25] decisively beat the Aquians, saving the legion and
[06:25 --> 06:26] ending the threat.
[06:27 --> 06:29] He marched back to Rome and celebrated his well-earned
[06:29 --> 06:32] triumph a mere fifteen days after being named dictator.
[06:33 --> 06:36] Before stepping down, though, Cincinnati did clear up
[06:36 --> 06:38] one bit of family business, forcing Virginia to plead
[06:38 --> 06:41] guilty to perjury and go into exile.
[06:41 --> 06:44] Rome safe and his family's honor restored, Cincinnati
[06:44 --> 06:46] resigned the dictatorship and returned to his farm,
[06:47 --> 06:49] a hero in his own time and a legend thereafter.
[06:51 --> 06:53] He would make one final appearance in the public
[06:53 --> 06:56] record twenty years later, again appointed as dictator,
[06:56 --> 06:59] though this time it was to deal with internal strife
[06:59 --> 07:00] and not an external threat.
[07:01 --> 07:03] Ironically, it was an attempt by a single man to
[07:03 --> 07:06] capture total power in Rome that led to the
[07:06 --> 07:07] reappointment of Cincinnati's dictator.
[07:08 --> 07:10] We will talk more next week about the plot of
[07:10 --> 07:13] Malleus to make himself king, so for now I will
[07:13 --> 07:16] just leave it that a conspiracy was in motion and
[07:16 --> 07:18] Cincinnati was brought in to deal with it, which he
[07:18 --> 07:21] did as quickly as he dispatched the Aequians and
[07:21 --> 07:23] again resigned the dictatorship and returned to
[07:23 --> 07:25] his farm, this time for the last time.
[07:27 --> 07:29] Cincinnati is a bona fide legend, but the
[07:29 --> 07:31] particulars of his life are almost certainly an
[07:31 --> 07:32] invention.
[07:32 --> 07:34] I look forward to the day when I begin covering
[07:34 --> 07:37] events from the later, more accurate records,
[07:37 --> 07:39] so I don't have to keep saying that the story
[07:39 --> 07:41] I've just told you is largely fictitious, but
[07:41 --> 07:43] we still have another fifty years before we get to
[07:43 --> 07:45] the sack of Rome, so we'll just have to grind
[07:45 --> 07:46] through this together.
[07:47 --> 07:49] Anyway, the story of Cincinnati is largely
[07:49 --> 07:52] fictitious, but the man was a giant of his age
[07:52 --> 07:54] and earned a little mythical embellishment,
[07:55 --> 07:57] and regardless of its accuracy, the life of
[07:57 --> 07:59] Cincinnati was handed down from generation to
[07:59 --> 08:01] generation and is still told today.
[08:02 --> 08:04] His story had a great impact on the
[08:04 --> 08:06] Enlightenment age soldiers of the American
[08:06 --> 08:08] Continental Army, who often referred to their
[08:08 --> 08:10] great leader, General Washington, as the
[08:10 --> 08:13] American Cincinnati, because at the end of
[08:13 --> 08:14] the war he retired rather than allow the
[08:14 --> 08:16] people to make him king.
[08:17 --> 08:19] When the Army was demobilized, the retired
[08:19 --> 08:21] officers formed a fraternity of sorts called
[08:21 --> 08:24] the Society of the Cincinnati, membership
[08:24 --> 08:25] in which was limited to men who had served
[08:25 --> 08:27] in the Army for three years.
[08:28 --> 08:29] One of their members was later the
[08:29 --> 08:31] Territorial Governor of Ohio, and he
[08:31 --> 08:34] renamed a growing urban hub on the Ohio
[08:34 --> 08:36] River Cincinnati, both in honor of the
[08:36 --> 08:38] Society itself and in honor of Washington,
[08:39 --> 08:40] to whom the name originally referred.
[08:41 --> 08:43] Ironically, the Society still exists today,
[08:43 --> 08:46] membership being limited to sons of the
[08:46 --> 08:48] original members, making it a hereditary
[08:48 --> 08:50] institution, completely anathema to
[08:50 --> 08:52] everything the officers had originally
[08:52 --> 08:54] been commissioned to fight, but I digress.
[08:55 --> 08:57] Since Annis' mark had been set upon
[08:57 --> 08:59] the world, but what do we make of him?
[09:00 --> 09:01] Clearly he was a towering figure in
[09:01 --> 09:03] the first century of the Republic, a
[09:03 --> 09:06] hero, a consul, a twice named dictator,
[09:06 --> 09:08] but why the iconic veneration?
[09:09 --> 09:11] Allegedly it is for the act of
[09:11 --> 09:13] relinquishing absolute power, but we have
[09:13 --> 09:14] already seen that Cincinnati was not
[09:14 --> 09:16] the first man to do this, nor would he be
[09:16 --> 09:19] the last. The office of dictator was
[09:19 --> 09:20] not created especially for him.
[09:20 --> 09:23] It was, in fact, a constitutional role
[09:23 --> 09:25] that was used regularly in times of
[09:25 --> 09:27] crisis. His story, of course, had a
[09:27 --> 09:29] nice ring to later Romans, who revel
[09:29 --> 09:31] in his simple homespun virtue,
[09:32 --> 09:33] called from his field to save the
[09:33 --> 09:36] city. In the good old days, they said,
[09:36 --> 09:38] the greatest man of his age was found
[09:38 --> 09:40] hard at work on a small farm, not
[09:40 --> 09:41] eating figs on a sofa in some
[09:41 --> 09:44] palatial estate. He was the epitome of
[09:44 --> 09:46] the virtuous farmer-soldier, the ideal
[09:46 --> 09:50] Roman. I think two things really
[09:50 --> 09:51] contribute to the fame of Cincinnati.
[09:52 --> 09:54] The first is the incidental fact that
[09:54 --> 09:56] most people, myself included before I
[09:56 --> 09:58] began digging, believe Cincinnati must
[09:58 --> 10:00] have either been the first dictator
[10:00 --> 10:02] of Rome, or the only dictator of Rome
[10:02 --> 10:04] to ever step down voluntarily, or
[10:04 --> 10:07] something equally unprecedented. But, of
[10:07 --> 10:08] course, there was nothing particularly
[10:08 --> 10:10] unprecedented about Cincinnati, and our
[10:10 --> 10:12] generation of him, in that case, would
[10:12 --> 10:14] seem to be based upon nothing more than
[10:14 --> 10:16] our own misconceptions about Roman
[10:16 --> 10:18] history. But even though Cincinnati
[10:18 --> 10:20] wasn't the first or last of anything,
[10:21 --> 10:23] he was unique in a profound way. The
[10:23 --> 10:25] first two dictators, who, like
[10:25 --> 10:27] Cincinnati, served and then resigned,
[10:28 --> 10:29] were men of a generation that
[10:29 --> 10:31] remembered the Tarquins, remembered
[10:31 --> 10:33] the tyranny, and would not think for
[10:33 --> 10:34] a moment about seizing power for
[10:34 --> 10:36] themselves so soon after they had
[10:36 --> 10:39] thrown out the kings. Cincinnati, on
[10:39 --> 10:40] the other hand, comes from the
[10:40 --> 10:42] next generation, a generation that
[10:42 --> 10:44] lived their entire lives under the
[10:44 --> 10:46] Republic, and was thus the first man who
[10:46 --> 10:48] had no memory of monarchy to be given
[10:48 --> 10:51] absolute power. The temptation to keep
[10:51 --> 10:53] it would not this time be tempered by
[10:53 --> 10:55] memories of subjugation and struggle.
[10:56 --> 10:57] But the virtue of Cincinnati's
[10:57 --> 10:59] return to the people the power that
[10:59 --> 11:01] was rightfully theirs. It was his
[11:01 --> 11:03] resignation from dictatorship that
[11:03 --> 11:04] really cemented the precedent for
[11:04 --> 11:06] later Romans to relinquish
[11:06 --> 11:08] dictatorial power and maintain the
[11:08 --> 11:10] Republic, that thing of the people.
[11:11 --> 11:13] In that case, Cincinnati really does
[11:13 --> 11:14] deserve all the praise he has given
[11:14 --> 11:16] for selflessly handing the reins of
[11:16 --> 11:17] power back to the people, where it
[11:17 --> 11:19] would remain for hundreds of years.
[11:20 --> 11:22] In any case, any man who
[11:22 --> 11:24] voluntarily gives up absolute power
[11:24 --> 11:26] is a hero whose story rightfully is
[11:26 --> 11:27] told.
[11:28 --> 11:29] Next week we will learn more about
[11:29 --> 11:31] the machinations of Malleus,
[11:31 --> 11:33] a scoundrel of the highest order, as
[11:33 --> 11:35] well as the events that led up to the
[11:35 --> 11:37] final confrontation with Vie, a
[11:37 --> 11:38] struggle that broke the back of
[11:38 --> 11:41] Etruscan dominance, which, though a
[11:41 --> 11:43] victory for Rome, opened the door for
[11:43 --> 11:44] the Gauls to sweep in from the North
[11:44 --> 11:46] and hand the Romans their most
[11:46 --> 11:48] devastating defeat, almost ending the
[11:48 --> 11:50] empire before it had a chance to
[11:50 --> 11:51] really begin.
[12:07 --> 12:07] you

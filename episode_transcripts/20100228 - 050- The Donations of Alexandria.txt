[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 50, The Donations of Alexandria.
[00:13 --> 00:16] Last week, we focused mainly on Octavian's trials in the West.
[00:17 --> 00:21] So this week, I want to begin by tracing Antony's activities in the East before moving
[00:21 --> 00:24] on to the final falling out between the two triumphor colleagues.
[00:25 --> 00:29] Because after failing miserably to conquer Parthia, Antony's status in Rome will plummet
[00:30 --> 00:35] leaving him vulnerable to political broadsides by Octavian, who will launch an all-out propaganda
[00:35 --> 00:36] blitz against him.
[00:36 --> 00:40] Neither being shrinking violence when it came to the game of power politics, the war
[00:40 --> 00:43] of words escalated quickly into simply war.
[00:45 --> 00:49] As I said last week, 41 BC had opened with bad news for the triumvirate.
[00:49 --> 00:54] While Octavian dealt with the revolt cooked up by Fulvia and Lucius Antony, Mark
[00:54 --> 00:57] Antony was faced with a preemptive strike by the Parthian Empire against Syria.
[00:58 --> 01:02] For the next three years, Antony's legions would be forced to engage in a running war
[01:02 --> 01:06] with the charismatic, popular, and brilliant Parthian Prince, Pakur.
[01:07 --> 01:11] Before the Romans were able to react, the Parthians had overrun Syria and Judea
[01:11 --> 01:13] and placed puppets on the thrones of both kingdoms.
[01:14 --> 01:18] Constantly distracted by internal Roman politics and the preparations for his larger
[01:18 --> 01:24] offensive, Antony left the prosecution of these initial Parthian campaigns to lieutenants,
[01:24 --> 01:27] specifically a capable general named Ventidius.
[01:28 --> 01:33] In 38 BC, Ventidius was able to corner and kill Pakur in battle outside of Antioch,
[01:33 --> 01:37] but he was curiously unwilling to follow up his victory and take an important
[01:37 --> 01:39] Parthian stronghold on the Euphrates River.
[01:40 --> 01:43] Word began to trickle back to Antony that Ventidius was accepting bribes to
[01:43 --> 01:45] hold back his forces.
[01:45 --> 01:49] So Antony relieved the general of command and headed out to take control of the
[01:49 --> 01:50] situation himself.
[01:51 --> 01:55] But with winter approaching and the city untaken, Antony prudently chose to
[01:55 --> 01:56] withdraw the attack.
[01:57 --> 02:01] Plutarch mentions that he took home with him some 300 Greek talents, a
[02:01 --> 02:04] friendly gift from the Parthians that of course had nothing to do with him
[02:04 --> 02:05] breaking off the siege.
[02:07 --> 02:10] In 37 BC though, Antony was ready to go on the attack.
[02:11 --> 02:15] Not only had he settled affairs with Octavian and renewed the triumvirate,
[02:15 --> 02:18] but he also reaffirmed his alliance with Queen Cleopatra.
[02:18 --> 02:22] As with the last time Antony and Cleopatra had established friendly terms
[02:22 --> 02:25] with one another, the most recent summit produced another child.
[02:27 --> 02:30] With all the money he would ever need and 100,000 troops finally organized and
[02:30 --> 02:35] ready for action, Antony decided it was high time he put his stamp on the east.
[02:35 --> 02:38] In the beginning, things went splendidly.
[02:38 --> 02:42] Basing himself out of Antioch, Antony swept through Syria and brought the
[02:42 --> 02:43] territory back under Roman control.
[02:44 --> 02:48] With this reclamation, it was time to do something about the unsatisfactory
[02:48 --> 02:51] political arrangements that had governed the east since the days of
[02:51 --> 02:52] Pompey the Great.
[02:53 --> 02:56] Specifically, Antony was tired of the weak-willed and half-hearted client
[02:56 --> 03:00] monarchies which left Rome without buffer states it could really trust.
[03:00 --> 03:04] So Antony deposed all the kings from Pontus to Judea, installing
[03:04 --> 03:06] Hellenized Monarchy he could trust.
[03:06 --> 03:10] Men, it should be noted, who were not just loyal to Antony and Rome,
[03:10 --> 03:12] but were capable administrators in their own right.
[03:13 --> 03:17] Indeed, after Antony's suicide in 30 BC, Octavian would survey the
[03:17 --> 03:21] political systems his dead colleague had left behind and see no reason to
[03:21 --> 03:22] disrupt any of it.
[03:24 --> 03:28] In 36 BC, almost 20 years after Crassus had taken his shot at Parthia,
[03:29 --> 03:32] and nearly a decade since Julius Caesar had begun planning his invasion,
[03:32 --> 03:35] Mark Antony finally ordered 100,000 troops to march east.
[03:36 --> 03:38] Rome was headed back into Parthia.
[03:39 --> 03:42] The captured legionary standards of Crassus were still being held as
[03:42 --> 03:44] trophies by the Parthian monarchy.
[03:44 --> 03:48] Antony intended to get them back, by diplomacy if necessary, but
[03:48 --> 03:49] hopefully by force.
[03:50 --> 03:53] In the end, he never had the opportunity to use either.
[03:53 --> 03:56] The invasion was a complete debacle.
[03:58 --> 04:01] Antony's legion set out in June and followed the route through Armenia laid
[04:01 --> 04:04] out by Julius Caesar and the route that should have been taken by Crassus.
[04:05 --> 04:09] But once in Parthian territory, Antony was, like Crassus before him,
[04:09 --> 04:11] at the mercy of local guides.
[04:12 --> 04:16] But this time, rather than leading him into a trap, his double-crossing
[04:16 --> 04:19] native guides simply fed information to the Parthians about the location
[04:19 --> 04:23] of the slow-moving and under-guarded Roman baggage train, emphasizing
[04:23 --> 04:26] particularly the slow-moving and under-guarded nature of it.
[04:27 --> 04:30] In a blow that crippled the whole enterprise, the Parthian cavalry
[04:30 --> 04:34] arrived out of nowhere and set fire to the line of carts, wagons,
[04:34 --> 04:36] and most importantly, siege works.
[04:37 --> 04:40] Having spent months moving slowly towards the inner fortresses of
[04:40 --> 04:42] Parthia, Antony was now in a bind.
[04:43 --> 04:46] His plan had been to capture at least one of the major cities before
[04:46 --> 04:48] the end of summer so he could establish winter quarters.
[04:49 --> 04:53] But now, with his siege engines gone, he had no hope of capturing anything.
[04:54 --> 04:57] With winter bearing down, Antony realized the whole invasion
[04:57 --> 04:59] was irretrievably bollocksed.
[04:59 --> 05:02] He ordered his stupefied men to turn around and head back
[05:02 --> 05:03] to the Mediterranean.
[05:05 --> 05:08] The second great blow came when the Armenian king took the occasion
[05:08 --> 05:11] of the smoldering baggage train to defect to the Parthians.
[05:12 --> 05:15] Antony's only route home now lay through hostile territory.
[05:16 --> 05:18] Winter set in across the hills and mountains of Armenia as
[05:18 --> 05:21] Antony struggled to get his army home in one piece.
[05:21 --> 05:24] While the Armenians prudently avoided outright attacking the
[05:24 --> 05:27] Romans, they certainly didn't offer any aid or comfort to
[05:27 --> 05:30] Antony's beleaguered army now dropping like flies in the
[05:30 --> 05:31] harsh mountain snows.
[05:32 --> 05:35] By the time they made it back to Antioch, 100,000 men who had
[05:35 --> 05:38] left for Parthia were now 75,000.
[05:38 --> 05:41] Antony had lost a quarter of his men and not even fought a
[05:41 --> 05:42] single battle.
[05:42 --> 05:45] He debated the pros and cons of suicide.
[05:47 --> 05:50] While his colleague was licking his wounds over the winter of
[05:50 --> 05:53] 36-35 BC, Octavian was riding high.
[05:54 --> 05:57] Having defeated Sextus Pompey, his own stock had never been
[05:57 --> 05:58] higher.
[05:58 --> 06:00] But though he was no doubt already planning to eliminate
[06:00 --> 06:04] Mark Antony from the picture, Octavian was content to let
[06:04 --> 06:06] the older triumvir dig his own grave for a while.
[06:07 --> 06:09] But until the time was right for a strike,
[06:09 --> 06:10] Octavian had a problem.
[06:11 --> 06:13] He couldn't afford to dismiss his legions.
[06:13 --> 06:14] He would need them for the inevitable
[06:14 --> 06:16] confrontation with Antony.
[06:16 --> 06:19] But with Sextus gone, he had no real reason to keep them
[06:19 --> 06:20] mobilized.
[06:20 --> 06:22] So Octavian looked around for some trouble to get mixed
[06:22 --> 06:25] up in and found the perfect excuse in Illyricum.
[06:26 --> 06:28] I can't disband the legions, he told the Senate.
[06:28 --> 06:31] I need them to fight those barbaric tribes in Illyricum
[06:31 --> 06:33] who have long thumbed their noses at Roman rule.
[06:34 --> 06:36] Yes, Illyricum, that's the ticket.
[06:37 --> 06:39] So rather than being told whether retirement plots were
[06:39 --> 06:42] located, Octavian soldiers got word that they were needed
[06:42 --> 06:43] for the war in Illyricum.
[06:44 --> 06:45] What war in Illyricum, they asked.
[06:46 --> 06:48] The war you're about to start, they were told.
[06:48 --> 06:49] Now get packed.
[06:51 --> 06:53] Illyricum was a wild country of fiercely independent
[06:53 --> 06:55] tribes located in what is today the Balkans.
[06:56 --> 06:58] So beyond giving him an excuse to keep his armies
[06:58 --> 07:01] intact, pacifying the region would be a real
[07:01 --> 07:04] propaganda coup for Octavian because Illyricum
[07:04 --> 07:07] didn't just border the empire, it bordered Italy itself.
[07:08 --> 07:11] Octavian spent the next two years off and on in the Balkans.
[07:11 --> 07:14] He constructed a fleet to tackle the pirate havens
[07:14 --> 07:16] off the east coast of the Adriatic and himself
[07:16 --> 07:18] led the infantry all over the countryside,
[07:18 --> 07:21] forcing tribe after tribe to acknowledge Roman rule.
[07:21 --> 07:24] He penetrated as far as the Danube River,
[07:24 --> 07:26] which Octavian dreamed one day would be the
[07:26 --> 07:28] stable border of the empire.
[07:29 --> 07:31] In the course of one siege, he even displayed
[07:31 --> 07:33] some of the personal courage that had always
[07:33 --> 07:35] been conspicuously absent from his career.
[07:36 --> 07:38] While his men hesitated on a gangplank
[07:38 --> 07:41] leading over a wall, Octavian and a few bodyguards
[07:41 --> 07:43] rushed headlong across the short bridge.
[07:44 --> 07:45] The episode mirrored a famous episode
[07:45 --> 07:47] from the career of Alexander the Great,
[07:48 --> 07:50] leading commentators even at the time
[07:50 --> 07:53] to suspect that the entire scene was a publicity stunt
[07:53 --> 07:55] engineered to dispose once and for all
[07:55 --> 07:57] of the persistent rumors of cowardice.
[07:58 --> 08:00] But whether intended or not, when reports of the
[08:00 --> 08:02] incident made their way back to Rome,
[08:02 --> 08:04] Octavian found his reputation greatly enhanced.
[08:07 --> 08:09] In 34 BC, while Octavian was entering
[08:09 --> 08:12] his second year in Illyricum, Antony was ready
[08:12 --> 08:14] to make amends for the shame of his disastrous invasion.
[08:16 --> 08:18] He had spent the year and a half that had passed
[08:18 --> 08:19] since returning from Parthia,
[08:19 --> 08:21] living with Cleopatra in Alexandria.
[08:22 --> 08:23] The fact that he was still married to Octavia
[08:23 --> 08:26] does not seem to have entered his head at all.
[08:26 --> 08:28] Though she had always been a loyal wife,
[08:28 --> 08:30] the bond between Antony and Cleopatra
[08:30 --> 08:33] had grown far beyond a mere political alliance.
[08:34 --> 08:36] Octavian privately, and pretty soon publicly,
[08:37 --> 08:39] fumed at Antony's blatantly disrespectful
[08:39 --> 08:40] treatment of his sister.
[08:41 --> 08:42] What did it say about him that he would ignore
[08:42 --> 08:45] a fine Roman woman in favor of some eastern temptress?
[08:47 --> 08:48] But regardless of what the chattering classes
[08:48 --> 08:51] thought about it, Antony was perfectly content
[08:51 --> 08:52] with his life in Egypt.
[08:52 --> 08:53] Some said he had no intention
[08:53 --> 08:55] of coming back to Rome at all.
[08:55 --> 08:56] And really, why would he?
[08:56 --> 08:59] He was passing his days in splendid luxury,
[08:59 --> 09:01] ruling over half the known world.
[09:02 --> 09:04] Alexandria was a rich, cosmopolitan,
[09:05 --> 09:06] and rationally laid out city.
[09:07 --> 09:10] In contrast to hot, crowded, noisy, and messy Rome,
[09:10 --> 09:11] there was really no comparison.
[09:13 --> 09:14] Arriving in the Egyptian capital
[09:14 --> 09:16] after defeating Antony and Cleopatra,
[09:17 --> 09:18] Octavian himself would be smitten
[09:18 --> 09:20] with the well thought out metropolis he found.
[09:21 --> 09:23] But rather than dream of moving to Egypt,
[09:23 --> 09:25] Octavian dreamed of reinventing Rome.
[09:26 --> 09:28] For the duration of his rule over the empire,
[09:28 --> 09:30] Octavian, later Augustus,
[09:30 --> 09:32] would spend enormous amounts of time,
[09:32 --> 09:34] energy, and treasure trying to remake Rome
[09:34 --> 09:36] in Alexandria's image,
[09:36 --> 09:38] to turn the city of Brick into a city of marble.
[09:41 --> 09:43] But while Antony slowly went native in Egypt,
[09:43 --> 09:45] his sense of Roman honor had not deserted him.
[09:46 --> 09:48] The betrayal of the Armenian king had not been forgotten,
[09:49 --> 09:51] and as soon as the spring of 34 BC rolled around,
[09:52 --> 09:54] Antony set out to remove the offending monarch.
[09:55 --> 09:57] Flashing some of the old brilliance,
[09:57 --> 09:59] he made short work of the Armenian army
[09:59 --> 10:01] and deposed the traitor king without too much difficulty.
[10:03 --> 10:04] The victory in Armenia, however,
[10:04 --> 10:06] would finally expose the growing distance
[10:06 --> 10:08] between Mark Antony and the Roman people.
[10:09 --> 10:11] Rather than finding some random, capable noble
[10:11 --> 10:13] to reign as the new king of Armenia,
[10:14 --> 10:16] Antony placed his own son Alexander on the throne.
[10:17 --> 10:19] An even greater affront
[10:19 --> 10:21] than the simple dynastic implications of the appointment
[10:21 --> 10:25] was that Alexander was Antony's son with Cleopatra,
[10:25 --> 10:28] not Octavia, and it only got worse after that.
[10:28 --> 10:30] When he returned home to Alexandria,
[10:30 --> 10:32] he staged a triumph to celebrate the victory.
[10:33 --> 10:35] Never in history had a triumph taken place
[10:35 --> 10:36] outside of Rome itself,
[10:36 --> 10:38] and Roman opinion was scandalized.
[10:40 --> 10:42] And as if the triumph itself wasn't bad enough,
[10:42 --> 10:44] at the culmination of the event,
[10:44 --> 10:46] Antony read a loud proclamation
[10:46 --> 10:47] that has since become known
[10:47 --> 10:48] as the donations of Alexandria.
[10:49 --> 10:52] Just as he had awarded control of Armenia to Alexander,
[10:52 --> 10:55] he announced his intention to give Cyrenaica and Libya
[10:55 --> 10:57] to Alexander's twin sister, Selene,
[10:57 --> 11:00] and granted his youngest son, Syria and Cilicia.
[11:01 --> 11:04] He declared Cleopatra to be the queen of kings,
[11:04 --> 11:05] and in the most provocative move of all,
[11:06 --> 11:09] named Caesarian, Julius Caesar's son by Cleopatra,
[11:09 --> 11:11] king of Egypt, king of kings,
[11:11 --> 11:13] and crucially, the true heir of his father.
[11:15 --> 11:16] When Octavian and the Senate heard about
[11:16 --> 11:19] this series of proclamations, they erupted in outrage.
[11:20 --> 11:21] Antony had gone off the reservation
[11:21 --> 11:23] and was now putting his illegitimate children
[11:23 --> 11:25] in control of Roman provinces.
[11:26 --> 11:28] He was, in short, turning the Eastern Empire
[11:28 --> 11:30] into his personal kingdom.
[11:32 --> 11:34] Octavian though, as much as he railed against Antony
[11:34 --> 11:36] in public for his monarchical ambitions,
[11:36 --> 11:38] was not nearly so concerned about
[11:38 --> 11:40] what child technically ruled what province
[11:40 --> 11:42] and who was inheriting what.
[11:42 --> 11:44] What troubled him was the massive navy
[11:44 --> 11:46] Antony was constructing.
[11:47 --> 11:49] All the military spending Antony
[11:49 --> 11:50] had been undertaking of late
[11:50 --> 11:53] was ostensibly for his planned reinvasion of Parthia.
[11:53 --> 11:56] But you have to wonder, who needs 400 ships
[11:56 --> 11:57] to invade the Iranian plateau?
[11:59 --> 12:00] And of course, when you got all the way
[12:00 --> 12:02] to the inner circle, the threat of Caesarian
[12:02 --> 12:04] was acutely felt.
[12:05 --> 12:06] Octavian's whole career was predicated
[12:06 --> 12:08] on being the heir of Julius Caesar.
[12:09 --> 12:11] True, in recent years, he had established himself
[12:11 --> 12:13] as his own man, but still,
[12:13 --> 12:16] people were following Gaius Julius Caesar for a reason.
[12:17 --> 12:19] If the claim of Caesarian's legitimacy
[12:19 --> 12:20] began to gain traction,
[12:21 --> 12:22] it could threaten the whole project.
[12:23 --> 12:26] Now, in Octavian's inner circle was of course Agrippa,
[12:27 --> 12:29] but there was also another man of equal importance
[12:29 --> 12:32] who I have thus far inexcusably neglected.
[12:33 --> 12:36] Gaius Macenus was about seven years older
[12:36 --> 12:37] than Octavian and Agrippa,
[12:37 --> 12:40] but he had fallen in with the two ambitious youths
[12:40 --> 12:40] early on.
[12:41 --> 12:43] He had been with Octavian in Apollonia
[12:43 --> 12:45] when news of Julius Caesar's assassination came,
[12:46 --> 12:48] and he had been a powerful force behind the scenes
[12:48 --> 12:50] throughout Octavian's rise to power.
[12:51 --> 12:54] Just as Agrippa was Octavian's chief military advisor,
[12:55 --> 12:56] Macenus was his chief political advisor.
[12:57 --> 12:59] He had been the guiding force behind Octavian's
[12:59 --> 13:01] first marriage to Scribonia,
[13:01 --> 13:03] as well as arranging the treaties
[13:03 --> 13:04] of Brundicium and Tarentum
[13:04 --> 13:07] that had avoided potential civil war with Antony.
[13:08 --> 13:10] While Agrippa and Octavian were off fighting battles,
[13:11 --> 13:12] it was Macenus who was left behind
[13:12 --> 13:14] to oversee things in Rome,
[13:14 --> 13:15] much like Antony had been left in charge
[13:15 --> 13:18] of the capital during the campaigns of Julius Caesar.
[13:19 --> 13:22] Much like Antony, too, Macenus had a penchant
[13:22 --> 13:24] for extravagant, indulgent living,
[13:24 --> 13:26] but where Antony embraced violent extremes,
[13:27 --> 13:29] Macenus was actually a moderating influence
[13:29 --> 13:32] on some of Octavian's more bloodthirsty tendencies.
[13:33 --> 13:35] His love of soft living and the arts, though,
[13:35 --> 13:37] were unmatched, which led to a tense relationship
[13:37 --> 13:39] with the stolid, battle-hardened,
[13:40 --> 13:41] and humorless Agrippa.
[13:42 --> 13:44] In the end, the two were held together
[13:44 --> 13:46] only by their mutual loyalty to Octavian,
[13:46 --> 13:48] but both proved to be indispensable
[13:48 --> 13:49] to their master's success.
[13:51 --> 13:52] Agrippa's role was obvious.
[13:52 --> 13:54] He won the great battles that put Octavian in power,
[13:55 --> 13:57] but, for example, it was Macenus's patronage
[13:57 --> 14:00] of the arts that was the key to the cult of personality
[14:00 --> 14:02] that would surround Caesar Augustus
[14:02 --> 14:03] and keep him in power.
[14:04 --> 14:06] Macenus cultivated the leading artists
[14:06 --> 14:09] and poets of the day, specifically Horace and Virgil,
[14:09 --> 14:11] and engaged them in a great project
[14:11 --> 14:13] to perpetually glorify his boss.
[14:14 --> 14:15] In the words of Anthony Everett,
[14:16 --> 14:18] Macenus somehow managed to keep them all on message
[14:18 --> 14:20] without resorting to the heavy hand of censorship,
[14:21 --> 14:23] which is, I can assure you, no mean feat
[14:23 --> 14:25] when dealing with independent creative types.
[14:26 --> 14:28] In our discussions of the reign of Augustus,
[14:28 --> 14:29] we will have much more to say
[14:29 --> 14:31] about both Macenus and Agrippa,
[14:31 --> 14:32] who will play as much a role
[14:32 --> 14:34] in the imperial administration
[14:34 --> 14:36] as they had played in establishing it.
[14:37 --> 14:38] At least from the time
[14:38 --> 14:40] the donations of Alexandria were announced,
[14:41 --> 14:43] the three old friends were actively plotting war
[14:43 --> 14:44] with Antony.
[14:45 --> 14:47] The trick was to bait him into making the first move
[14:47 --> 14:50] so Octavian would not look like the aggressor.
[14:51 --> 14:54] Octavian slated himself to hold the consulship for 33 BC,
[14:54 --> 14:55] and from that position,
[14:55 --> 14:57] he planned to do everything in his power
[14:57 --> 14:59] to turn Rome against Antony.
[15:00 --> 15:02] On the first day he presided over the Senate,
[15:02 --> 15:05] Octavian let loose with the most inflammatory attacks
[15:05 --> 15:06] he could think of.
[15:06 --> 15:09] Antony was living in sin with Cleopatra in the east.
[15:09 --> 15:12] Antony had betrayed the honor of blameless Octavia.
[15:12 --> 15:16] Antony had illegally executed Sextus Pompey without trial.
[15:16 --> 15:18] Antony started wars with foreign powers
[15:18 --> 15:19] without the consent of the Senate.
[15:20 --> 15:22] Antony was making himself a king.
[15:22 --> 15:24] In short, Antony was the enemy
[15:24 --> 15:27] of all that was good, pure, and decent about Rome.
[15:29 --> 15:30] For the rest of the year,
[15:30 --> 15:33] Octavian and Antony were engaged in a war of words
[15:33 --> 15:35] for the hearts and minds of Romans everywhere.
[15:35 --> 15:37] Antony sent letters back to the Senate
[15:37 --> 15:39] that were read aloud by his supporters,
[15:39 --> 15:41] claiming that Octavian had forged
[15:41 --> 15:42] the adoption papers of Julius Caesar,
[15:43 --> 15:46] that he was consumed with a megalomaniacal lust for power,
[15:46 --> 15:49] that he was a low-born provincial who had lied,
[15:49 --> 15:51] cheated, and stolen his way up the political ladder.
[15:52 --> 15:53] It was also whispered
[15:53 --> 15:56] that Octavian had engaged in unnatural relations
[15:56 --> 15:58] with his uncle on his way back from Spain
[15:58 --> 16:00] in order to win Caesar's favor.
[16:02 --> 16:03] When 32 BC came around
[16:03 --> 16:05] and Octavian's turn in the consulship ended,
[16:06 --> 16:09] the propaganda war had played out to a near stalemate.
[16:09 --> 16:11] But in provoking the confrontations,
[16:12 --> 16:14] Octavian had succeeded in at least one important respect.
[16:15 --> 16:18] With the Triumvirate expiring December 31, 33 BC,
[16:19 --> 16:21] there was no chance now that it would be renewed.
[16:22 --> 16:24] The 10-year-old partnership was officially dissolved.
[16:25 --> 16:28] Now the facade of collegial alliance could be dropped.
[16:28 --> 16:29] They were rivals and enemies.
[16:30 --> 16:32] It was time for everyone to come right out and say it.
[16:33 --> 16:35] Octavian even used the occasion
[16:35 --> 16:36] of the Triumvirate's expiration
[16:36 --> 16:38] to hit Antony with a solid body blow.
[16:39 --> 16:40] He made sure he was out in front,
[16:41 --> 16:43] declaring that he would no longer be addressed as triumvirate
[16:43 --> 16:45] as he had been for the last decade.
[16:46 --> 16:47] That was all in the past.
[16:47 --> 16:49] The preeminence of the consuls in the Senate
[16:49 --> 16:50] had returned to Rome for good.
[16:52 --> 16:54] When Antony, though, refused to give up the title
[16:54 --> 16:56] he had grown accustomed to, Octavian pounced,
[16:57 --> 16:59] arguing that Antony had no legal standing,
[16:59 --> 17:00] no right to the title,
[17:00 --> 17:03] and technically no official role in the state whatsoever.
[17:04 --> 17:06] If he continued to wield executive power in the East,
[17:07 --> 17:08] he was doing so illegally
[17:08 --> 17:11] and usurping the power of the Senate and the consuls.
[17:12 --> 17:14] He saved his best for Cleopatra,
[17:14 --> 17:17] who he built up as some sort of evil sorceress
[17:17 --> 17:18] who had hypnotized Antony
[17:18 --> 17:19] and controlled him like a puppet.
[17:20 --> 17:22] It was important that Octavian lay as much
[17:22 --> 17:24] at the feet of Cleopatra as he could.
[17:25 --> 17:27] He was hoping to induce the Senate into declaring war,
[17:27 --> 17:29] and he knew that they would find it far easier
[17:29 --> 17:32] to direct their ire at an evil foreign queen
[17:32 --> 17:33] than at Mark Antony himself,
[17:34 --> 17:35] who had spent his entire adult life
[17:35 --> 17:36] in the service of Rome.
[17:39 --> 17:40] Unfortunately for Octavian,
[17:40 --> 17:42] many in the Senate weren't having
[17:42 --> 17:43] these over-the-top accusations
[17:43 --> 17:46] and were not ready to abandon Antony just yet.
[17:47 --> 17:48] And in fact, by a stroke of luck,
[17:49 --> 17:51] the two consuls for the year 32 BC
[17:51 --> 17:53] also happened to be Antony loyalists.
[17:54 --> 17:56] They denounced Octavian for his slander
[17:56 --> 17:59] and introduced a resolution to censure young Caesar.
[18:00 --> 18:01] Unwilling to accept the rebuke,
[18:02 --> 18:04] Octavian was forced to reveal what everybody already knew,
[18:05 --> 18:08] that despite having given up his triumvirate title,
[18:08 --> 18:10] he was not giving up on power.
[18:11 --> 18:12] He unilaterally and illegally called
[18:12 --> 18:13] a meeting of the Senate
[18:13 --> 18:16] and addressed the charges brought against him,
[18:16 --> 18:18] conspicuously flanked by armed bodyguards.
[18:19 --> 18:21] This proved to be a fatal breach of protocol.
[18:22 --> 18:24] In protest, fully one-third of the Senate
[18:24 --> 18:26] packed their bags and left Rome,
[18:26 --> 18:27] headed for Alexandria.
[18:28 --> 18:30] Included in their ranks were the two consuls
[18:30 --> 18:32] who took with them all the official
[18:32 --> 18:33] executive authority of the state.
[18:34 --> 18:36] Octavian, who had for years been claiming
[18:36 --> 18:38] his subservience to the Constitution,
[18:39 --> 18:40] was now forced to reveal his true colors.
[18:41 --> 18:43] He didn't give a whit about the Constitution.
[18:44 --> 18:45] He had no official position within the state,
[18:46 --> 18:47] but there was no doubt about it.
[18:47 --> 18:49] Octavian ruled Rome.
[18:51 --> 18:54] Later in the year, he received a gift from the East.
[18:54 --> 18:56] A high-ranking defector from Alexandria
[18:56 --> 18:59] brought with him the pretext that Octavian could use
[18:59 --> 19:02] to finally induce a declaration of war on Antony.
[19:02 --> 19:05] It seems that Antony had recently lodged a will
[19:05 --> 19:06] in the Temple of the Vestas,
[19:07 --> 19:08] the contents of which, if known,
[19:09 --> 19:10] would finally reveal the depths
[19:10 --> 19:12] of his abandonment of Rome.
[19:13 --> 19:15] Octavian demanded that the Vestal Virgins
[19:15 --> 19:16] produce the document,
[19:16 --> 19:18] but citing sacred oaths, they refused.
[19:20 --> 19:22] Undeterred, Octavian simply stormed the temple
[19:22 --> 19:23] and seized the will.
[19:24 --> 19:25] Romans everywhere were shocked
[19:25 --> 19:28] by this unthinkable violence against the temple,
[19:28 --> 19:30] but when Octavian began reading passages
[19:30 --> 19:31] of the document aloud,
[19:31 --> 19:34] they soon forgot all about Octavian's sacrilege.
[19:35 --> 19:37] Antony had left large portions of his estate
[19:37 --> 19:38] to his illegitimate children,
[19:38 --> 19:40] reaffirmed the claim that Caesarian
[19:40 --> 19:42] was the true heir of Julius Caesar,
[19:42 --> 19:43] which was, it should be noted,
[19:43 --> 19:45] an impossibility within Roman law,
[19:45 --> 19:47] as Cleopatra was not a citizen.
[19:48 --> 19:49] But most shocking of all,
[19:49 --> 19:51] he requested to be buried in Alexandria
[19:51 --> 19:52] rather than Rome.
[19:54 --> 19:55] Octavian argued that Antony
[19:55 --> 19:56] had betrayed his Roman heritage,
[19:57 --> 19:58] and that it was high time for the Senate
[19:58 --> 20:00] to recognize that he was an enemy of the state.
[20:01 --> 20:03] Moved by the revelations contained in the will,
[20:04 --> 20:06] the Senate, well, two-thirds of the Senate anyway,
[20:07 --> 20:08] declared war on Egypt.
[20:09 --> 20:10] The moment of truth had come.
[20:11 --> 20:12] Octavian and Antony
[20:12 --> 20:13] were finally going to face off in battle.
[20:14 --> 20:15] The prize?
[20:15 --> 20:17] Sole control of the Roman Empire.
[20:19 --> 20:21] Antony knew what was coming down the pike
[20:21 --> 20:22] as soon as a third of the Senate
[20:22 --> 20:24] showed up on his doorstep.
[20:24 --> 20:26] The 400 ships he had built
[20:26 --> 20:29] for the invasion of Parthia
[20:29 --> 20:30] were soon sailing for Greece.
[20:31 --> 20:32] In a crucial development,
[20:33 --> 20:35] Antony decided not to lead the fleet all by himself,
[20:36 --> 20:38] but appointed Cleopatra as co-general.
[20:39 --> 20:40] There's no straight answer
[20:40 --> 20:42] for why he chose to elevate Cleopatra
[20:42 --> 20:43] to this high rank in the army,
[20:44 --> 20:46] but the effect was almost wholly negative.
[20:47 --> 20:49] The Romans who had fled Italy to join with Antony
[20:49 --> 20:51] now found themselves subservient to a woman
[20:51 --> 20:52] and a foreigner,
[20:52 --> 20:54] a situation they found intolerable.
[20:55 --> 20:56] This is in no way meant
[20:56 --> 20:58] to knock the capabilities of Cleopatra
[20:58 --> 21:01] or get bogged down in comments on Roman misogyny,
[21:02 --> 21:03] but it's simply to point out
[21:03 --> 21:06] that the Queen's position did prove to be a corrosive acid
[21:06 --> 21:08] eating slowly at the heart of morale
[21:08 --> 21:09] in the Antonian camp.
[21:10 --> 21:12] But Antony had ignored advice to leave her behind,
[21:13 --> 21:15] or better yet, kill her and annex Egypt,
[21:15 --> 21:17] and the two set sail for Greece,
[21:17 --> 21:19] ready for the showdown with Octavian.
[21:21 --> 21:23] By the winter of 32-31 BC,
[21:23 --> 21:25] the bulk of the Antonian fleet
[21:25 --> 21:27] settled into the Ambracean Gulf
[21:27 --> 21:29] on the coast of the Ionian Sea.
[21:30 --> 21:31] It was a curious choice of positions.
[21:32 --> 21:34] When it came to strategically locating armies
[21:34 --> 21:36] for east-west showdowns,
[21:36 --> 21:38] the common assumptions was that the ports
[21:38 --> 21:40] along the Adriatic were far more valuable.
[21:41 --> 21:43] By stowing his fleet far to the south,
[21:43 --> 21:46] Antony essentially ceded Octavian an opportunity
[21:46 --> 21:49] to ferry ground forces from Brundisium over to Derechium.
[21:50 --> 21:51] Historians have postulated
[21:51 --> 21:54] that Antony was as concerned as Octavian
[21:54 --> 21:55] about looking like an aggressor,
[21:55 --> 21:56] and wanted to clearly signal
[21:56 --> 21:59] that his intention was not to invade Italy,
[21:59 --> 22:01] so he chose not to plant a huge navy
[22:01 --> 22:02] off the coast of the peninsula.
[22:03 --> 22:05] He may also have been concerned
[22:05 --> 22:06] about keeping his supply lines from,
[22:07 --> 22:09] and escape route back to, Egypt open.
[22:10 --> 22:13] Whatever the final calculus that led to the decision was,
[22:13 --> 22:15] the upshot was that with his fleet
[22:15 --> 22:16] in the Ambracean Gulf,
[22:16 --> 22:18] when it came time to sail out in the spring,
[22:18 --> 22:21] he would have to pass the small port town of Actium,
[22:21 --> 22:23] which stood at the head of the narrow entrance to the Gulf.
[22:26 --> 22:28] Prior to their falling out,
[22:28 --> 22:30] Octavian and Antony had been slated to share a year
[22:30 --> 22:32] in the consulship in 31 BC.
[22:33 --> 22:36] With Antony persona non grata in Octavian's Rome,
[22:36 --> 22:39] young Caesar took his position as senior executive
[22:39 --> 22:40] without Antony in the way.
[22:41 --> 22:44] Octavian began to claim, not totally inaccurately,
[22:44 --> 22:47] that traitorous Mark Antony was leading a foreign army
[22:47 --> 22:49] against the legitimate government of Rome.
[22:49 --> 22:52] It was true that Antony served no official capacity,
[22:53 --> 22:54] and that his legions were led
[22:54 --> 22:56] and recruited largely from the east,
[22:56 --> 22:58] while Octavian, as the rightful consul,
[22:58 --> 23:00] was leading armies drawn from Italy itself.
[23:01 --> 23:04] But at this point, everyone knew what the score was.
[23:05 --> 23:07] No one bought the hype that one side was fighting
[23:07 --> 23:09] for Rome and the other side against Rome,
[23:09 --> 23:12] or for the constitution or against the constitution.
[23:12 --> 23:14] This was just two powerful men
[23:14 --> 23:16] using the resources of the empire
[23:16 --> 23:18] to decide once and for all
[23:18 --> 23:20] which one of them would run the whole show.
[23:22 --> 23:23] Octavian and Agrippa decided
[23:23 --> 23:25] that their best shot against Antony,
[23:25 --> 23:27] who, despite all their propaganda and slanders,
[23:28 --> 23:30] they never once underestimated as a military commander,
[23:31 --> 23:32] was to act boldly.
[23:33 --> 23:35] Antony had set up a critical supply hub at Mithone
[23:35 --> 23:37] in the southwest Peloponnese.
[23:38 --> 23:39] If the city could be taken,
[23:40 --> 23:41] Antony would find himself without access
[23:41 --> 23:43] to fresh supplies and susceptible
[23:43 --> 23:45] to a maritime siege of Actium.
[23:46 --> 23:49] So in March 31 BC, before the winter was out,
[23:49 --> 23:52] Agrippa led a daring run through the storming waters
[23:52 --> 23:55] of the Ionian and launched a surprise assault on the city,
[23:55 --> 23:57] capturing it before Antony could react.
[23:58 --> 23:59] When the spring arrived,
[23:59 --> 24:02] Octavian hastily ferried 50,000 ground forces
[24:02 --> 24:04] across the Adriatic and marched them south.
[24:05 --> 24:07] Suddenly, Antony was trapped.
[24:07 --> 24:09] Octavian's forces prevented him
[24:09 --> 24:10] from marching his army overland
[24:10 --> 24:12] out of the Ambracian Gulf
[24:12 --> 24:14] while Agrippa's navy positioned itself off the coast
[24:14 --> 24:17] and dared him to try to sail out of danger.
[24:18 --> 24:19] Antony recognized immediately
[24:19 --> 24:21] what a disastrous position he was in.
[24:22 --> 24:24] Just as with the failed Parthian expedition,
[24:24 --> 24:26] he knew that his only hope was retreat.
[24:27 --> 24:29] He had to get back to Egypt and regroup
[24:29 --> 24:30] or all would be lost.
[24:30 --> 24:32] And he had to do it fast, too.
[24:33 --> 24:34] His men were badly under supplied
[24:34 --> 24:38] and trapped in confined quarters during the summer heat
[24:38 --> 24:39] were falling prey to disease,
[24:40 --> 24:41] the great scourge of armies.
[24:42 --> 24:43] To top things off,
[24:43 --> 24:45] reports came daily listing off
[24:45 --> 24:46] which high ranking officials
[24:46 --> 24:48] had slipped across the lines during the night.
[24:49 --> 24:52] His allies and his gods were deserting him.
[24:53 --> 24:55] Next week, Antony will make a break for it.
[24:56 --> 24:57] Though at the time,
[24:57 --> 24:59] the Battle of Actium was an important,
[24:59 --> 25:02] but not necessarily decisive victory for Octavian,
[25:02 --> 25:04] history would soon be written by the victors
[25:04 --> 25:08] to portray it as the great and final triumph of Octavian
[25:08 --> 25:09] over the enemies of Rome.

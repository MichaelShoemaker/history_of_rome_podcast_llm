[00:03 --> 00:06] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:12] Last time we finished with the death of Romulus, first and greatest King of Rome.
[00:13 --> 00:18] Today we will cover his first three successors, who they were, and what roles they played
[00:18 --> 00:20] in the evolution of Roman law and society.
[00:21 --> 00:25] I called this section the Seven Kings of Rome because common historical nomenclature
[00:25 --> 00:28] always refers to the Seven Kings of Rome.
[00:29 --> 00:33] So though we will only be talking about three kings, it seemed appropriate to use the phrase
[00:33 --> 00:36] as a title even if it isn't technically accurate.
[00:36 --> 00:39] Just remember, there were seven kings of Rome.
[00:41 --> 00:45] Oh, by the way, in reality, there were almost certainly more than seven kings of Rome.
[00:46 --> 00:50] The idea that seven successive kings could reign for an average of 35 years each
[00:50 --> 00:52] stretches credulity.
[00:52 --> 00:57] Nowhere else in the history of mankind have seven monarchs in a row managed such continuous
[00:57 --> 00:58] good luck.
[00:58 --> 01:03] The stories handed down to us of Pneuma and Hostilius and Martius and the Tarquins
[01:03 --> 01:07] are no doubt apocryphal, meant to cover the ground between Romulus and the founding
[01:07 --> 01:12] of the Republic, while explaining the evolution of the city's culture at the same time.
[01:12 --> 01:16] So just remember, even though there weren't really seven kings of Rome, there were
[01:16 --> 01:18] seven kings of Rome.
[01:19 --> 01:23] After Romulus died or disappeared, there was a crisis.
[01:23 --> 01:26] Who would lead the Romans now that their first and only king was gone?
[01:27 --> 01:32] Trouble arose not just from the question of which particular man would reign, but
[01:32 --> 01:34] also from the question of what tribe he would be from.
[01:35 --> 01:39] The Sabines, who would suffer the sole rule of Romulus in silence, now wished
[01:39 --> 01:41] to see one of their own placed upon the throne.
[01:42 --> 01:46] The Romans found this idea preposterous, but the Sabines refused all Roman candidates,
[01:46 --> 01:49] and the Romans, in turn, refused all Sabine candidates.
[01:50 --> 01:54] To avoid a slip in anarchy, it was decided that each senator in succession would
[01:54 --> 01:58] reign for a single day until an acceptable man was found to rule.
[01:58 --> 02:02] This was the first instance in Roman history of an interregnum, or period
[02:02 --> 02:04] between official sovereigns.
[02:04 --> 02:08] A compromise was finally proposed that allowed the Romans to choose whomever
[02:08 --> 02:12] they wished, without Sabine veto, as long as the man was a Sabine.
[02:13 --> 02:17] The Romans agreed to this and picked a man of universal renown, Numa Pompulius.
[02:18 --> 02:22] The Sabines, delighted by the choice, agreed at once, and messengers were sent
[02:22 --> 02:24] to Numa to present him with the good news.
[02:25 --> 02:29] To the amazement of everyone, however, Numa refused the offer, and it was only
[02:29 --> 02:31] after much cajoling that he agreed to take the throne.
[02:32 --> 02:34] You see, Numa was a bit of an odd bird.
[02:34 --> 02:39] He disdained all luxury and had devoted his life to religious contemplation.
[02:39 --> 02:43] He often took long walks alone, and it was believed that on these strolls he
[02:43 --> 02:44] conversed with the gods.
[02:45 --> 02:46] Not that this concerned anyone.
[02:46 --> 02:50] Quite the opposite, it only enhanced his reputation that the gods spoke to him.
[02:50 --> 02:54] But still, not exactly a man you usually find at the head of a growing
[02:54 --> 02:55] military power.
[02:56 --> 02:57] Numa did not even live in Rome.
[02:57 --> 03:01] He resided in a nearby town and was, for the most part, put off by
[03:01 --> 03:02] the violence and greed of the city.
[03:03 --> 03:06] This second King of Rome was the opposite of Romulus in almost every way.
[03:06 --> 03:09] Where Romulus was brash, Numa was reserved.
[03:10 --> 03:12] Where Romulus was a warrior, Numa was a pacifist.
[03:13 --> 03:17] Where Romulus sought glory and fame, Numa sought peace and solitude.
[03:17 --> 03:21] Overnight, he changed the trajectory of Rome's march to greatness.
[03:22 --> 03:26] When Numa arrived in Rome, he found a warmongering population of brutes who
[03:26 --> 03:28] had known 40 years of war.
[03:28 --> 03:31] And when he died, he left Rome a population of farmers who had known 40
[03:31 --> 03:32] years of peace.
[03:33 --> 03:37] The remarkable transformation was due entirely to Numa's introduction of
[03:37 --> 03:38] religion to the city.
[03:38 --> 03:41] He turned the people's attention away from the battlefield and
[03:41 --> 03:42] towards the heavens.
[03:43 --> 03:47] Desiring peace more than anything else, Numa devised complex religious rights
[03:47 --> 03:51] to occupy the time of the now demobilized army so they would not
[03:51 --> 03:53] grow restless and provoke unnecessary wars.
[03:54 --> 03:57] He instilled in the Romans an everlasting fear and awe of the gods,
[03:57 --> 03:59] which would last for the remainder of the empire.
[04:01 --> 04:04] Numa is credited with the foundation of the most important religious
[04:04 --> 04:06] institutions in Rome.
[04:06 --> 04:10] He imported the Vestal Virgins and established the laws governing their
[04:10 --> 04:11] watch over the eternal flame.
[04:12 --> 04:15] He created the office of Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of Rome,
[04:16 --> 04:19] who would be responsible for the maintenance of all religious services.
[04:19 --> 04:23] And in an act of remarkable foresight, declined to serve in that role
[04:23 --> 04:26] himself, establishing a sovereign religious realm that could not be
[04:26 --> 04:28] meddled with by future kings.
[04:29 --> 04:32] He believed that later kings would be so caught up in war making that
[04:32 --> 04:35] they would neglect their religious duties and bring the wrath of the
[04:35 --> 04:36] gods upon the city.
[04:37 --> 04:40] The office of Pontifex Maximus would remain an independent authority
[04:40 --> 04:43] until the title was claimed for the emperors by Augustus at the
[04:43 --> 04:44] dawn of the imperium.
[04:45 --> 04:48] At the end of the empire, the title was passed to the popes, who
[04:48 --> 04:52] hold it to this day, 2,600 years after its inception.
[04:54 --> 04:57] Just as Romulus is the answer to all questions about the founding of
[04:57 --> 05:00] the city, Pneuma is the answer to all questions about the origin
[05:00 --> 05:01] of religious practices.
[05:02 --> 05:04] Who divided regular days from holy days?
[05:04 --> 05:05] Pneuma.
[05:05 --> 05:07] Who created the priesthood of Mars?
[05:07 --> 05:08] Pneuma did.
[05:08 --> 05:10] The priesthood of Quirinius?
[05:10 --> 05:10] Pneuma.
[05:11 --> 05:12] Who built the altar to Jupiter?
[05:12 --> 05:13] Pneuma, of course.
[05:14 --> 05:17] In the development of Roman culture, Pneuma is second only to
[05:17 --> 05:20] Romulus in importance, and to some, he was even more important.
[05:21 --> 05:25] Machiavelli writes, and for anyone who considers Roman history
[05:25 --> 05:28] it is clear how much religion helped in the commanding of armies,
[05:29 --> 05:32] in inspiring the plebeians, in keeping men good, and in making
[05:32 --> 05:33] the wicked feel shame.
[05:34 --> 05:37] Thus, if one were to debate about the prince to whom Rome
[05:37 --> 05:40] owed the most, I think Pneuma would sooner obtain the first
[05:40 --> 05:43] place, for where there is religion, one can easily
[05:43 --> 05:46] introduce arms, but where there are arms, but no religion,
[05:46 --> 05:49] the former can only be introduced with difficulty.
[05:50 --> 05:53] Perhaps Pneuma's most famous addition to Rome was the
[05:53 --> 05:54] Temple of Janus.
[05:54 --> 05:57] The gates of the temple were to remain open while Rome was
[05:57 --> 05:59] at war, and be closed in times of peace.
[06:00 --> 06:03] For the entirety of Pneuma's reign, the doors stayed shut.
[06:04 --> 06:06] But after his passing, they remained open almost
[06:06 --> 06:07] continuously.
[06:07 --> 06:10] Pneuma's dream of peace, it would seem, died with him,
[06:10 --> 06:13] and his reign would be an anomaly in Roman history.
[06:14 --> 06:18] Of Pneuma's Rome, Livy writes, once Rome's neighbors
[06:18 --> 06:21] had considered her no more than an armed camp in their
[06:21 --> 06:22] midst, threatening the general peace.
[06:22 --> 06:26] Now they came to revere her so profoundly as a community
[06:26 --> 06:29] dedicated wholly to worship, that the mere thought of
[06:29 --> 06:32] offering her violence seemed to them like sacrilege.
[06:33 --> 06:36] Pneuma reigned 43 years and died in 673 BC.
[06:37 --> 06:39] His successor to the throne, Tullus Hostilius,
[06:39 --> 06:42] did his level best to banish forever this image of
[06:42 --> 06:45] Rome as a city of docile farmer-priests.
[06:46 --> 06:50] Just as Pneuma was the opposite of Romulus, Tullus
[06:50 --> 06:51] was the opposite of Pneuma.
[06:51 --> 06:54] He longed for a return to the martial virtues of Romulus.
[06:55 --> 06:57] He believed Pneuma had left the Romans soft and
[06:57 --> 07:00] dangerously unprepared for what Tullus saw as
[07:00 --> 07:02] inevitable attack from eternally hostile neighbors.
[07:03 --> 07:05] The peace of the previous decades could not hold
[07:05 --> 07:08] forever, and if Rome was to live, it had to fight.
[07:09 --> 07:11] With this in mind, Tullus looked around for a clash
[07:11 --> 07:13] that would reinvigorate the warrior spirit of his
[07:13 --> 07:16] people and found it in the place of Romulus's birth.
[07:17 --> 07:20] A cattle-raiding dispute along the border between
[07:20 --> 07:23] Rome and Alba led to mutual recriminations, and
[07:23 --> 07:26] for Tullus, this was enough of a pretext and war
[07:26 --> 07:27] was declared.
[07:27 --> 07:29] He even managed to arrange things so that the
[07:29 --> 07:31] Romans looked like the aggrieved party who were
[07:31 --> 07:34] being dragged against their will into battle.
[07:35 --> 07:37] Armies from both sides advanced on one another,
[07:38 --> 07:40] but before the order for full-scale engagement
[07:40 --> 07:43] was given, Medius, the leader of the Albans,
[07:43 --> 07:45] approached Tullus with an unusual proposal.
[07:46 --> 07:48] There was nothing to be gained, the Albans said,
[07:48 --> 07:51] in a bloody struggle between two familial people,
[07:52 --> 07:54] when the Etruscans sat at both their doorsteps,
[07:54 --> 07:57] eagerly awaiting any opportunity to invade.
[07:57 --> 08:00] A fight between Alba and Rome would deplete the
[08:00 --> 08:02] strength of both Victor and Vanquished, leaving
[08:02 --> 08:04] the door wide open for the Etruscans to make
[08:04 --> 08:05] them all slaves.
[08:06 --> 08:09] Medius proposed that single combat should decide
[08:09 --> 08:10] their quarrel.
[08:10 --> 08:12] That way their respective armies could still
[08:12 --> 08:14] keep the ambitious Etruscans in check.
[08:15 --> 08:17] Tullus agreed reluctantly, seeing the logic
[08:17 --> 08:19] of Medius' argument, though it would not be
[08:19 --> 08:22] single combat per se that would decide things.
[08:23 --> 08:25] Each army's ranks held three brothers, triplets,
[08:26 --> 08:28] who were chosen to fight for the fate of their people.
[08:29 --> 08:31] This fight between the Roman Herati and the
[08:31 --> 08:33] Albans Curiati is an episode, like the Rape of
[08:33 --> 08:36] the Sabine Women, that has found its way into
[08:36 --> 08:37] countless works of art and literature,
[08:38 --> 08:40] most famously in the Oath of the Herati by
[08:40 --> 08:43] Jacques-Louis David, that great lover of antiquity.
[08:44 --> 08:46] In front of the opposing armies, the two sets
[08:46 --> 08:47] of brothers squared off.
[08:48 --> 08:50] The fight was furious, and in quick succession
[08:50 --> 08:51] two of the Romans lay dead.
[08:52 --> 08:54] Horatius, the remaining brother, knowing he
[08:54 --> 08:56] could not take all three of his enemies at once,
[08:57 --> 08:59] ran up a nearby hill, forcing the three
[08:59 --> 09:00] Curiati to chase him.
[09:01 --> 09:03] As the first neared, Horatius turned abruptly
[09:03 --> 09:04] and killed him.
[09:04 --> 09:06] The second Albans brother arrived too late to
[09:06 --> 09:09] help, and Horatius fought and killed him as well.
[09:09 --> 09:12] The third Curiati, weary from the chase and
[09:12 --> 09:14] from wounds sustained in the earlier fight,
[09:14 --> 09:16] was no match at all upon arrival.
[09:16 --> 09:19] He fell to his knees, and Horatius did not
[09:19 --> 09:21] fight him so much as execute him,
[09:21 --> 09:23] plunging his sword down the poor bastard's throat.
[09:25 --> 09:27] The Romans cheered their victory, and the
[09:27 --> 09:29] Albans, grumbling at Medius' deal, were
[09:29 --> 09:31] forced to withdraw and supplicate
[09:31 --> 09:32] themselves to Roman rule.
[09:33 --> 09:35] But Medius, aware of how precarious his
[09:35 --> 09:37] authority was in the aftermath of this
[09:37 --> 09:39] non-defeat to Rome, conspired to release
[09:39 --> 09:41] his people from subjugation.
[09:41 --> 09:44] He induced V.A., the nearest Etruscan city
[09:44 --> 09:46] and, as we will later see, an important
[09:46 --> 09:49] early rival of Rome, to attack the Romans.
[09:49 --> 09:51] The Albans, Medius said, would be called
[09:51 --> 09:54] upon to aid Rome, and he promised that
[09:54 --> 09:55] at a decisive moment in the battle,
[09:56 --> 09:58] the Albans would desert, leaving the
[09:58 --> 09:59] Roman flank unguarded.
[09:59 --> 10:01] V.A. jumped at the opportunity to crush
[10:01 --> 10:03] Rome and attacked immediately.
[10:03 --> 10:06] Just as Medius predicted, Tullus called
[10:06 --> 10:07] upon the Albans to join the fight,
[10:07 --> 10:09] and the armies gathered to do battle.
[10:10 --> 10:12] Just as the fight was about to begin,
[10:12 --> 10:14] Medius ordered the Albans to withdraw.
[10:14 --> 10:16] The Roman soldiers were shocked to see
[10:16 --> 10:18] their ally suddenly leaving, but Tullus,
[10:18 --> 10:20] thinking quickly, addressed his troops,
[10:20 --> 10:22] telling them that it was his plan
[10:22 --> 10:24] for the Albans to sneak around behind the enemy.
[10:25 --> 10:27] The Romans, heartened, marched into
[10:27 --> 10:29] battle with confidence and defeated the Vaeites.
[10:30 --> 10:32] Back in camp, however, Tullus ordered
[10:32 --> 10:34] the arrest of Medius and had him
[10:34 --> 10:35] brought before the Roman troops.
[10:36 --> 10:37] Tullus then revealed the treachery
[10:37 --> 10:39] of the Albans leader and, to the horror
[10:39 --> 10:41] of his men, passed, without trial,
[10:41 --> 10:43] a sentence of death by dismemberment.
[10:44 --> 10:46] Their leader dead, Tullus then
[10:46 --> 10:48] ordered the destruction of Alba Longa itself.
[10:49 --> 10:50] He ordered the city destroyed,
[10:50 --> 10:52] and the citizens relocated to Rome,
[10:52 --> 10:53] where they would become Romans,
[10:54 --> 10:56] forever wiping Alba from the map.
[10:57 --> 11:01] Tullus ran 32 years and died in 642 B.C.
[11:01 --> 11:04] The return to arms was his lasting legacy,
[11:04 --> 11:05] and the incorporation of the Albans
[11:05 --> 11:07] was his most important contribution
[11:07 --> 11:09] to the growth of the city.
[11:10 --> 11:11] Henceforth, Rome's neighbors returned
[11:11 --> 11:13] to their view of the city as little more
[11:13 --> 11:15] than an armed camp and worked tirelessly
[11:15 --> 11:17] to defeat the Roman menace.
[11:17 --> 11:20] Never again would Rome enjoy an extended period
[11:20 --> 11:22] of uninterrupted peace, despite the efforts
[11:22 --> 11:25] made by Tullus' successor, Ancus Martius,
[11:25 --> 11:27] the grandson of Pneuma, to bring the population
[11:27 --> 11:30] back to his grandfather's vision of peace.
[11:31 --> 11:33] Less is known or told about Ancus
[11:33 --> 11:35] than any of his predecessors,
[11:35 --> 11:37] but we do know that he attempted to follow
[11:37 --> 11:39] in the footsteps of his grandfathers,
[11:39 --> 11:41] but with far less success.
[11:41 --> 11:43] Events conspired to force war upon him,
[11:43 --> 11:45] and despite his natural proclivities,
[11:45 --> 11:48] he accepted his fate and led the Romans into battle.
[11:49 --> 11:51] A confederation of Latin communities
[11:51 --> 11:53] who chafed under Roman dominance
[11:53 --> 11:56] took Ancus' succession as the perfect opportunity
[11:56 --> 11:58] to attack, believing they had another Pneuma
[11:58 --> 12:00] on their hands who would be an easy mark.
[12:01 --> 12:02] But Ancus accepted the challenge,
[12:02 --> 12:05] and the Roman forces, battle-tested by their years
[12:05 --> 12:07] under Tullus, routed each in turn.
[12:08 --> 12:11] The defeated inhabitants were forced, like the Albans,
[12:11 --> 12:13] to abandon their homes and settle in Rome,
[12:13 --> 12:16] while Romans were sent to settle the vacated towns.
[12:16 --> 12:19] Through this policy, the population of the city swelled,
[12:19 --> 12:21] and the surrounding countryside was filled
[12:21 --> 12:22] with subjects loyal to Rome.
[12:24 --> 12:26] At the outset of the fight with the Latins,
[12:26 --> 12:28] Ancus made his most important contribution
[12:28 --> 12:32] to Roman society, dissatisfied with the haphazard way
[12:32 --> 12:34] the war began between Rome and her enemies,
[12:34 --> 12:36] he decided to inject a sacred ritual,
[12:36 --> 12:37] introducing something of Pneuma
[12:37 --> 12:39] into the barbarism of armed conflict.
[12:40 --> 12:42] A specific formula was proscribed
[12:42 --> 12:44] as to how exactly the Romans would declare war
[12:44 --> 12:47] on an enemy, too tedious to spell out here,
[12:47 --> 12:50] but it involved sending envoys into enemy territory,
[12:50 --> 12:52] announcing the war to the first man met
[12:52 --> 12:53] in an official pronouncement,
[12:54 --> 12:57] making more official declarations at appointed times,
[12:57 --> 13:00] waiting 33 days, and finally throwing a spear
[13:00 --> 13:02] into enemy territory, signaling the beginning
[13:02 --> 13:03] of hostilities.
[13:04 --> 13:06] The entire process may seem a bit overwrought,
[13:06 --> 13:08] but it demonstrates the Roman desire
[13:08 --> 13:11] to infuse all aspects of life with the rule of law,
[13:11 --> 13:14] even if the end result was savage bloodshed.
[13:15 --> 13:17] After the campaign against the Latins,
[13:18 --> 13:20] Ancus won an important victory against the Vaeites,
[13:20 --> 13:22] gaining control of the Maishan forest
[13:22 --> 13:24] and extending Roman territory all the way to the sea.
[13:25 --> 13:28] The consequences of this event cannot be overstated.
[13:28 --> 13:30] Through Ostia, the port town founded by Ancus
[13:30 --> 13:33] at the mouth of the Tiber, all initial Roman forays
[13:33 --> 13:36] into the Mediterranean were launched and received.
[13:37 --> 13:40] Ancus reigned 24 years and died in 617 BC.
[13:41 --> 13:44] At his death, Rome found itself immeasurably strengthened
[13:44 --> 13:46] by the addition of countless new citizens,
[13:46 --> 13:48] a neighborhood free of enemies,
[13:48 --> 13:49] and a port to call its very own.
[13:50 --> 13:52] We will leave the story here and pick up next time
[13:52 --> 13:55] with the final three kings, the Tarquin dynasty,
[13:55 --> 13:57] the last of which would show himself
[13:57 --> 14:00] to be such a tyrant that the very idea of monarchy
[14:00 --> 14:02] would be hateful to Romans forever after,
[14:02 --> 14:04] even forcing the emperors
[14:04 --> 14:05] to semantically cloak their activities
[14:05 --> 14:08] so as not to be accused of monarchism.
[14:10 --> 14:12] As I said earlier, the lives of these kings
[14:12 --> 14:14] are apocryphal biographies designed to explain
[14:14 --> 14:17] the origin and development of Rome to later Romans.
[14:18 --> 14:19] What is mostly being fleshed out
[14:19 --> 14:21] in the story of these first kings
[14:21 --> 14:24] is the relationship between the two most important pillars
[14:24 --> 14:26] of Roman society, war and religion.
[14:27 --> 14:30] The warlike Romulus is followed by the religious Numa,
[14:30 --> 14:32] who is followed by the warlike Tullus,
[14:32 --> 14:34] until finally the two pillars are joined in Ancus,
[14:34 --> 14:37] the religious king who is dragged into battle by fate.
[14:38 --> 14:39] This interplay is instructive
[14:39 --> 14:42] and offers a neat encapsulation of their character.
[14:43 --> 14:45] The Romans are a warlike people tempered by religion,
[14:46 --> 14:48] not a religious people forged into warriors.
[14:49 --> 14:51] Ultimately, it is war, not prayer,
[14:51 --> 14:52] that defines the Romans.
[14:53 --> 14:54] Imagine if it had been the opposite,
[14:54 --> 14:57] a people founded by a religious pacifist
[14:57 --> 14:58] and succeeded by a warrior
[14:58 --> 15:00] who was then succeeded by a pacifist
[15:00 --> 15:02] who was then succeeded by a warrior
[15:02 --> 15:04] dragged by fate into a religious life.
[15:05 --> 15:06] It paints a very different picture.
[15:07 --> 15:09] The Romans are fighters through and through,
[15:09 --> 15:11] though Machiavelli's point is well taken.
[15:12 --> 15:13] Without religious tempering,
[15:13 --> 15:15] it is doubtful the Romans could have sustained
[15:15 --> 15:17] a republic based upon the rule of law
[15:17 --> 15:19] and would have remained an unremarkable tribe
[15:19 --> 15:20] of violent barbarians.
[15:21 --> 15:23] To sum up, the Romans were soldiers
[15:23 --> 15:24] who took oath seriously,
[15:24 --> 15:27] not priests who took swordsmanship seriously.
[15:29 --> 15:30] Join me next time as we discuss
[15:30 --> 15:32] the last days of the Roman monarchy
[15:32 --> 15:34] and what was so bad about Tarquinius Superbus,
[15:34 --> 15:35] the last king of Rome,
[15:36 --> 15:38] that led the city to transform itself
[15:38 --> 15:41] into a republic that lasted for 500 years.

[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, Episode 54, All in the Family.
[00:12 --> 00:16] Before we get started, I just want to thank everyone for their feedback on the sponsorship
[00:16 --> 00:17] issue.
[00:18 --> 00:20] Based on the comments, it looks like ads will be a go.
[00:21 --> 00:24] I'm not sure exactly when they're going to start, but I promise not to let it
[00:24 --> 00:28] get in the way of anything and the content itself won't change a bit.
[00:28 --> 00:33] When we left off last week, Augustus had set his sights on clearing out the last pockets
[00:33 --> 00:38] of resistance to Roman rule within the existing boundaries of the Empire, before setting
[00:38 --> 00:42] out to push those boundaries northwest to the Danube and Elbe rivers.
[00:43 --> 00:47] Tiberius and his younger brother, Drusus, both in their early 20s, had been put in
[00:47 --> 00:52] charge of the initial phase, pacifying the independent tribes living in and around
[00:52 --> 00:52] the Alps.
[00:53 --> 00:57] As I mentioned at the end of last week, it was important that Augustus elevate his
[00:57 --> 01:00] stepsons to prominence as quickly as possible.
[01:00 --> 01:04] The princeps' health had always been a concern, and even though he wound up
[01:04 --> 01:08] living well into his 70s, the specter of sudden death always loomed large in
[01:08 --> 01:09] his mind.
[01:10 --> 01:14] Agrippa had thus far served admirably as a backstop in case Augustus were to die,
[01:14 --> 01:18] but let's face it, he was growing old as quickly as Augustus was.
[01:19 --> 01:23] A new generation would have to be ready to step forward if and when the princeps
[01:23 --> 01:23] died.
[01:24 --> 01:28] It is worth pointing out, though, that as much as selfishness contributed to
[01:28 --> 01:32] Augustus' promotion of his stepsons because he wanted power to remain within
[01:32 --> 01:35] the family, he also had his eye firmly on the public good.
[01:36 --> 01:40] By having a well-established succession plan in place, Augustus could die
[01:40 --> 01:44] knowing that when he did, it would not plunge his people back into
[01:44 --> 01:45] immediate civil war.
[01:47 --> 01:50] But just as Agrippa had been a necessary stand-in when true descendants of
[01:50 --> 01:55] Augustus were unavailable, Tiberius and Drusus were now being set up to play
[01:55 --> 01:56] much the same role.
[01:57 --> 02:00] Though Augustus liked and trusted his stepsons, he was still biased
[02:00 --> 02:03] towards passing power to a blood relative.
[02:04 --> 02:06] It's almost as if the claim that he was not setting up a monarchy
[02:06 --> 02:09] dominated by a royal family was completely bogus.
[02:10 --> 02:14] The temporary status of Tiberius and Drusus' heirs' parent became
[02:14 --> 02:17] clear once Agrippa and Julia's new family began to grow.
[02:18 --> 02:22] After marrying his best friend to his only daughter in 21 BC,
[02:23 --> 02:26] Augustus kept a close eye on the new couple, hoping they would produce
[02:26 --> 02:28] a long-term solution to his dynastic problems.
[02:29 --> 02:32] It did not take long for Augustus to be greeted with the happy news
[02:32 --> 02:36] that Julia had given birth to a son, Gaius, in 20 BC.
[02:37 --> 02:40] More good news followed, as the marriage of Agrippa and Julia
[02:40 --> 02:43] proved to be a fertile one, and year after year, they produced
[02:43 --> 02:45] child after child.
[02:45 --> 02:52] In 19 BC, Julia the Younger was born, in 17 BC, a second son, Lucius.
[02:52 --> 02:56] Three years later, Agrippina the Elder was born, followed in 12 BC
[02:56 --> 03:00] by the final son, Agrippa Postumus, so named because he was born
[03:00 --> 03:03] after the unfortunate early death of his father,
[03:03 --> 03:04] which we will get to in a moment.
[03:05 --> 03:08] In addition to this week's maps, which highlights the Danube
[03:08 --> 03:12] provinces secured during the period, I have also posted a family
[03:12 --> 03:14] tree of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.
[03:14 --> 03:17] They are a tricky bunch to keep track of, because not only did
[03:17 --> 03:20] they share about three total names between the whole lot of them,
[03:20 --> 03:23] so which Agrippina are we talking about again?
[03:23 --> 03:26] There was also some pretty heavy intermarriage going on.
[03:26 --> 03:29] So I hope the family tree will help you sort everyone out.
[03:29 --> 03:32] Keep it handy, because it should be good for about 80 more years.
[03:34 --> 03:36] As I was saying, though, the births of Gaius and Lucius
[03:36 --> 03:39] immediately put a sell-by date on Tiberius and Drusus.
[03:40 --> 03:43] In a highly irregular move, Augustus decided to adopt the boys
[03:43 --> 03:46] when they were still infants, bring them into his household,
[03:46 --> 03:47] and raise them himself.
[03:48 --> 03:51] There was simply too much at stake not to involve himself
[03:51 --> 03:53] in every aspect of their lives and education.
[03:54 --> 03:56] One of them was destined to sit on the throne.
[03:57 --> 03:59] Augustus needed to make sure that they would be ready.
[04:00 --> 04:03] But just because there was a planned obsolescence now
[04:03 --> 04:05] built into Tiberius and Drusus,
[04:05 --> 04:07] that did not mean that Augustus could simply ignore them.
[04:08 --> 04:11] It would be 20 years or more before Gaius and Lucius
[04:11 --> 04:14] could even begin the process of establishing public lives
[04:14 --> 04:15] for themselves.
[04:15 --> 04:18] Tiberius and Drusus were ready now.
[04:18 --> 04:21] And with all the illnesses that had felled him over the years,
[04:21 --> 04:24] Augustus knew that lasting the 20 years before his grandsons
[04:24 --> 04:27] would be ready to take over was a dicey prospect at best.
[04:28 --> 04:30] Plus, the ancient world being what it was,
[04:30 --> 04:32] there was no guarantee that Gaius and Lucius
[04:32 --> 04:34] would even survive childhood.
[04:34 --> 04:37] It was best to keep as many irons in the fire as possible.
[04:38 --> 04:41] So on the off chance that either Tiberius or Drusus
[04:41 --> 04:44] was indeed destined to succeed him to the throne,
[04:44 --> 04:46] Augustus made sure that everything stayed
[04:46 --> 04:48] in the tight family he was building.
[04:49 --> 04:52] So in 19 BC, he had Tiberius marry Vipsania,
[04:52 --> 04:55] the daughter of Marcus Agrippa by his first wife.
[04:55 --> 04:58] And not long after, Drusus married Antonia,
[04:58 --> 05:00] the daughter of Augustus' sister Octavia,
[05:00 --> 05:02] and ironically enough, Mark Antony.
[05:03 --> 05:05] Both marriages were happy ones,
[05:05 --> 05:06] though in the case of Tiberius,
[05:07 --> 05:09] it was this very happiness that would open up a rift
[05:09 --> 05:11] with Augustus that would be the hallmark
[05:11 --> 05:13] of their future relationship with each other.
[05:15 --> 05:18] In 17 BC, Augustus began to set the stage
[05:18 --> 05:19] for his imperial expansion.
[05:20 --> 05:22] That year, one of his generals in Gaul
[05:22 --> 05:24] lost a minor battle to some Germanic tribes.
[05:25 --> 05:28] Rather than letting the incident pass without notice,
[05:28 --> 05:30] Augustus saw his opportunity
[05:30 --> 05:32] to open up legal war in Germania.
[05:33 --> 05:36] Just as is the case with most every civilized country
[05:36 --> 05:39] across history, Rome never just declared war.
[05:39 --> 05:42] Hostilities were only opened once Rome
[05:42 --> 05:44] or one of their allied kingdoms was attacked.
[05:45 --> 05:47] It was very important to the Roman sense of themselves
[05:47 --> 05:50] that they only entered into just wars of self-defense.
[05:51 --> 05:53] In theory, this meant that they were always
[05:53 --> 05:56] on strong moral footing when they marched off to war,
[05:56 --> 05:58] but in practice, this meant that they simply seized
[05:58 --> 06:01] on the flimsiest pretext to launch a campaign.
[06:02 --> 06:04] Now, Augustus had his flimsy pretext.
[06:05 --> 06:07] He traveled himself to Gaul
[06:07 --> 06:09] and began reorganizing the legions there
[06:09 --> 06:11] to prepare them for what would no doubt be
[06:11 --> 06:13] a difficult push across the Rhine River
[06:13 --> 06:15] to the banks of the Elbe.
[06:15 --> 06:17] The princeps would remain in the province
[06:17 --> 06:19] for a good three years, keeping himself
[06:19 --> 06:22] within easy reach of all the campaigns he had initiated.
[06:24 --> 06:27] The first major push, as I said at the end of last week,
[06:27 --> 06:29] was Tiberius and Jerusalem's invasion
[06:29 --> 06:32] of what would become the province of Raetia,
[06:32 --> 06:35] which covered modern-day Switzerland and part of Austria.
[06:36 --> 06:38] In the single summer of 15 BC,
[06:38 --> 06:40] the two brothers ruthlessly prosecuted
[06:40 --> 06:43] a war of pacification against the tribes living there.
[06:43 --> 06:45] The cause's bellae for the invasion, I should note,
[06:46 --> 06:47] was some reported ill treatment
[06:47 --> 06:49] of Roman citizens passing through the territory.
[06:50 --> 06:52] Flimsy pretexts, I has them.
[06:53 --> 06:54] Rather than being satisfied
[06:54 --> 06:56] with simply beating the tribes on the battlefield
[06:56 --> 06:58] and turning them into taxpayers,
[06:58 --> 07:00] the two brothers decided that the best way
[07:00 --> 07:02] to ensure the mountainous region
[07:02 --> 07:04] remained safe for Roman travelers
[07:04 --> 07:07] was to initiate a mass deportation of the men.
[07:08 --> 07:09] Those who weren't sold into slavery
[07:09 --> 07:11] were marched at spear point off their land.
[07:12 --> 07:16] Women, children, and old men were left behind
[07:16 --> 07:18] to keep the region nominally populated,
[07:18 --> 07:19] but completely defenseless.
[07:21 --> 07:23] Neighboring Raetia, incorporating the rest
[07:23 --> 07:26] of modern Austria, was the recently consolidated,
[07:26 --> 07:29] if still unofficial, province of Noricum.
[07:30 --> 07:31] The tribes there had been friends of Rome
[07:31 --> 07:35] since at least 170 BC and had actually been
[07:35 --> 07:36] important allies of Julius Caesar
[07:36 --> 07:38] during his civil wars against the Senate.
[07:39 --> 07:42] In 16 BC, all Augustus had to do
[07:42 --> 07:44] was order a proconsul in to occupy the land.
[07:45 --> 07:47] The formal annexation of all the land
[07:47 --> 07:49] south of the Danube was well underway.
[07:51 --> 07:53] With Roman intentions obvious,
[07:53 --> 07:56] the recently passive tribes inhabiting Pannonia
[07:56 --> 07:57] rose up against encroachment.
[07:58 --> 08:00] They had been beaten soundly by Augustus
[08:00 --> 08:03] during his Illyrian campaigns 20 years earlier,
[08:03 --> 08:05] but their territory had not been officially
[08:05 --> 08:06] incorporated into the empire.
[08:08 --> 08:10] The fiercely independent Pannonian tribes
[08:10 --> 08:12] could barely stand unofficial servitude,
[08:12 --> 08:13] so there was no way they were going
[08:13 --> 08:15] to be able to stand official servitude.
[08:16 --> 08:18] And with the legions on the march,
[08:18 --> 08:20] that sure looked like what they were headed for.
[08:21 --> 08:23] But that fierce independence would ironically
[08:23 --> 08:25] sow the seeds for their loss of it,
[08:25 --> 08:27] because not only were they predisposed
[08:27 --> 08:28] to standing apart from Rome,
[08:28 --> 08:30] they were also predisposed
[08:30 --> 08:31] to standing apart from each other.
[08:32 --> 08:34] Unable to establish a united front,
[08:34 --> 08:36] the tribes were easily picked off one by one.
[08:37 --> 08:39] That is not to say that the conquest of Pannonia
[08:39 --> 08:40] took place overnight,
[08:41 --> 08:43] as the conquest of Raetia basically had,
[08:43 --> 08:45] but just to say that the outcome
[08:45 --> 08:46] was never really in doubt.
[08:48 --> 08:51] In 13 BC, the 29-year-old Tiberius
[08:51 --> 08:53] served his consul for the first time,
[08:54 --> 08:55] obviously long before he should have
[08:55 --> 08:57] qualified for that office.
[08:57 --> 09:00] Lifting age restrictions for his possible heirs
[09:00 --> 09:02] was one of Augustus's favorite tricks
[09:02 --> 09:04] to give them a leg up on the competition.
[09:05 --> 09:07] When his year in the consulship was done,
[09:07 --> 09:09] Tiberius would qualify for any number
[09:09 --> 09:11] of pro-consulships in the provinces,
[09:11 --> 09:12] where he could continue to grow
[09:12 --> 09:13] his power and prestige.
[09:14 --> 09:16] All the while, his peers would be hoping
[09:16 --> 09:19] against hope to nail down that first quaestorship.
[09:21 --> 09:24] 13 BC also marked, finally,
[09:24 --> 09:25] the passing of Marcus Lepidus.
[09:26 --> 09:28] The old triumvirate had managed to last
[09:28 --> 09:31] another 25 years living in comfortable obscurity
[09:31 --> 09:34] after being booted from the triumvirate in 36 BC.
[09:35 --> 09:38] The one concession Augustus had allowed Lepidus
[09:38 --> 09:39] when the latter left the public stage
[09:39 --> 09:42] was allowing him to remain as Pontifex maximus,
[09:43 --> 09:45] an office he had held since the death of Julius Caesar.
[09:46 --> 09:47] When Lepidus died,
[09:47 --> 09:50] Augustus naturally assumed the high priesthood.
[09:51 --> 09:53] Now, the princeps was the official head
[09:53 --> 09:55] of all three branches of Roman public life,
[09:56 --> 09:58] the church, the state, and the military.
[10:00 --> 10:01] At the end of the year,
[10:02 --> 10:04] with operations in Pannonia going well,
[10:04 --> 10:07] but not perfectly, Augustus sent in Marcus Agrippa
[10:07 --> 10:09] to bring the annexation to a speedy conclusion.
[10:10 --> 10:13] Eager to get started, Agrippa immediately set sail
[10:13 --> 10:15] for the Balkans and spent the winter there,
[10:15 --> 10:17] planning the next summer's campaign.
[10:18 --> 10:21] But it was a campaign that he would not live to see.
[10:21 --> 10:24] Suffering from a number of nagging ailments,
[10:24 --> 10:26] Agrippa caught sick and was forced to return home
[10:26 --> 10:27] in March of 12 BC.
[10:29 --> 10:32] But landing in Brundisium, he took a turn for the worse.
[10:33 --> 10:36] Messengers raced to Rome to deliver the news to Augustus
[10:36 --> 10:38] who dropped what he was doing and rushed to Brundisium,
[10:38 --> 10:40] but by the time he got there, it was too late.
[10:41 --> 10:42] Marcus Agrippa was dead.
[10:44 --> 10:47] It would be difficult to overstate what a blow this was.
[10:48 --> 10:50] Agrippa was basically the reason
[10:50 --> 10:52] Augustus had gotten anywhere in life.
[10:52 --> 10:54] The inherited name of Julius Caesar
[10:54 --> 10:56] was obviously the catalyst for his rise,
[10:57 --> 10:58] and the savvy advice of Messinus
[10:58 --> 11:00] helped him pick his way through the treacherous world
[11:00 --> 11:02] of Roman politics.
[11:02 --> 11:04] But it would all have been for naught
[11:04 --> 11:05] without victories on the battlefield.
[11:06 --> 11:08] And all of Augustus' most important victories
[11:08 --> 11:11] against First Sextus Pompey and then Mark Antony
[11:11 --> 11:13] had been won by Agrippa.
[11:14 --> 11:16] The death of the great general at age 51
[11:16 --> 11:20] was a harsh reminder that while he was now all powerful,
[11:20 --> 11:23] Augustus never really had been able to do it alone.
[11:23 --> 11:25] The question of what would happen
[11:25 --> 11:27] the next time a key military victory was required
[11:27 --> 11:30] must have weighed heavy on Augustus' mind.
[11:30 --> 11:32] Because not only had he been able to trust Agrippa
[11:32 --> 11:33] to win the battle,
[11:34 --> 11:35] but he could also trust Agrippa
[11:35 --> 11:37] not to betray him afterwards.
[11:38 --> 11:40] The next great battle, if such a thing occurred,
[11:40 --> 11:42] would be fraught with danger for the regime.
[11:43 --> 11:45] Defeat would mean a loss of legitimacy,
[11:46 --> 11:48] while victory would mean a new rival for power.
[11:49 --> 11:52] The death of Agrippa was bad news for Augustus
[11:52 --> 11:54] no matter which way he sliced it.
[11:55 --> 11:57] But that did not mean Augustus
[11:57 --> 11:58] was going to simply cash in his chips
[11:58 --> 12:01] or linger too long over the death of his friend.
[12:02 --> 12:04] After escorting Agrippa's body back to Rome,
[12:05 --> 12:06] Augustus placed the remains
[12:06 --> 12:08] in his own recently constructed mausoleum.
[12:08 --> 12:11] So at least in death, the two friends would be reunited.
[12:13 --> 12:14] But when he closed the doors on the tomb,
[12:14 --> 12:16] it was time to move on.
[12:17 --> 12:18] The key question was what to do
[12:18 --> 12:20] with his now twice-widowed daughter, Julia.
[12:22 --> 12:24] He mulled over, but then dismissed the idea
[12:24 --> 12:26] of marrying her to an ally outside the family.
[12:27 --> 12:29] No, Augustus wanted to keep everything
[12:29 --> 12:31] in a nice tight little bundle,
[12:31 --> 12:33] so he settled on marrying her to Tiberius.
[12:35 --> 12:37] The only problem was that Tiberius
[12:37 --> 12:38] was happily married to Vipsonium,
[12:39 --> 12:41] and he had no desire to marry the woman
[12:41 --> 12:43] who had so recently been his stepmother-in-law.
[12:44 --> 12:47] He and Vipsonium had already produced a healthy son
[12:47 --> 12:49] named Nero Claudius Jerusus,
[12:49 --> 12:51] named unusually after his uncle
[12:51 --> 12:54] rather than Tiberius himself, as was the custom.
[12:55 --> 12:56] But when Augustus made up his mind,
[12:56 --> 12:58] he made up everybody's mind.
[12:59 --> 13:01] Tiberius was forced to divorce Vipsonium
[13:01 --> 13:02] and marry Julia.
[13:03 --> 13:04] The bitterness over the incident
[13:04 --> 13:06] grew slowly in Tiberius.
[13:06 --> 13:09] Sparked at first simply by his longing for Vipsonium,
[13:10 --> 13:12] but then nursed into a full-blown fiery rage
[13:12 --> 13:15] when he really got to know his new wife.
[13:16 --> 13:19] The problem was that the two were simply not compatible.
[13:20 --> 13:22] Tiberius was conservative, thoughtful,
[13:23 --> 13:25] and at times an admittedly humorless man.
[13:26 --> 13:28] He was smart, talented, and ambitious,
[13:28 --> 13:30] but embraced none of the flamboyance
[13:30 --> 13:32] that had come to mark Julia's personality.
[13:34 --> 13:35] As the only daughter of Augustus,
[13:35 --> 13:38] Julia had been raised in a pampered world
[13:38 --> 13:39] of wealth and privilege.
[13:40 --> 13:41] But now that she was grown up,
[13:41 --> 13:43] she was not daddy's little girl anymore.
[13:43 --> 13:46] She was now simply a pawn in her father's dynastic games.
[13:48 --> 13:50] Never one to consider his daughter's feelings,
[13:50 --> 13:53] Augustus married her off as was politically expedient
[13:53 --> 13:55] and then took her sons Gaius and Lucius away
[13:55 --> 13:57] at the first opportunity.
[13:58 --> 14:00] In response, Julia began to act out
[14:00 --> 14:03] against her father's obsession with traditional morality
[14:03 --> 14:05] and proceeded to carry on affairs
[14:05 --> 14:06] with Rome's leading men,
[14:07 --> 14:09] essentially making a fool out of Augustus
[14:09 --> 14:10] behind his moralizing back.
[14:12 --> 14:13] Tiberius stepped into the situation
[14:13 --> 14:16] and soon found himself playing the cuckold.
[14:17 --> 14:19] But as much as Tiberius disdained his new wife,
[14:19 --> 14:22] it seems that Julia was no great fan of Tiberius's either.
[14:23 --> 14:25] She even sent a letter to her father
[14:25 --> 14:27] through an intermediary denouncing Tiberius
[14:27 --> 14:30] as unworthy of her hand in marriage and beneath her.
[14:31 --> 14:33] After their only child died in infancy,
[14:33 --> 14:36] Tiberius seems to have renounced marital relations
[14:36 --> 14:38] with Julia, not that she cared.
[14:40 --> 14:42] After Agrippa died, Tiberius inherited
[14:42 --> 14:44] not just the general's widow,
[14:44 --> 14:46] but also his command in Pannonia.
[14:47 --> 14:49] Drusus meanwhile was placed in charge
[14:49 --> 14:50] of the armies of the Rhine
[14:50 --> 14:53] and in contrast to Tiberius's unhappy private life,
[14:53 --> 14:55] found his own family a source of great joy.
[14:57 --> 14:59] His marriage to Antonia was a happy one
[14:59 --> 15:00] and produced three children,
[15:00 --> 15:03] each destined for a life in the public eye.
[15:04 --> 15:07] Drusus returned the compliment Tiberius had paid him
[15:07 --> 15:08] by naming his own eldest son,
[15:09 --> 15:13] born in either 16 or 15 BC, Nero Claudius Tiberius.
[15:13 --> 15:15] Of course, we know the boy today
[15:15 --> 15:19] by the agnomen he inherited from his father, Germanicus.
[15:20 --> 15:24] Filling out the family was Julia Lovilla, born in 13 BC,
[15:25 --> 15:28] and the reversely named Tiberius Claudius Nero,
[15:28 --> 15:29] born in 10 BC.
[15:30 --> 15:32] Obviously the Romans were not much for unique naming,
[15:32 --> 15:34] so from here on out,
[15:34 --> 15:36] I'll be referring to them as Germanicus,
[15:36 --> 15:38] Lovilla, and Claudius respectively.
[15:39 --> 15:40] And in case you didn't already know,
[15:40 --> 15:42] yes, that Claudius.
[15:43 --> 15:46] The young family was the toast of the Roman world.
[15:46 --> 15:48] Drusus, unlike his sad sack
[15:48 --> 15:49] and socially awkward older brother,
[15:50 --> 15:52] was outgoing and universally popular.
[15:53 --> 15:56] Antonia herself soon joined the auspicious ranks
[15:56 --> 15:59] of Cornelia Africana, mother of the Gracchi brothers,
[15:59 --> 16:00] and her own mother, Octavia,
[16:00 --> 16:04] as a near deified paragon of womanly virtue.
[16:05 --> 16:07] When Drusus died, she refused to remarry,
[16:07 --> 16:09] eventually living another five decades
[16:09 --> 16:10] without ever taking a new husband,
[16:11 --> 16:13] a highly unusual state of affairs.
[16:15 --> 16:17] From 11 BC to nine BC,
[16:18 --> 16:19] the two step-sons of Augustus
[16:19 --> 16:21] battled their way into hostile territory.
[16:22 --> 16:24] Tiberius had the easier time of it
[16:24 --> 16:27] because, as I said, the tribes of Pannonia
[16:27 --> 16:28] remained too disconnected
[16:28 --> 16:30] to really prove a match for the legions.
[16:31 --> 16:33] But Germania was a different story.
[16:34 --> 16:36] The tribes there were larger, tougher,
[16:36 --> 16:37] and more strategically advanced
[16:37 --> 16:39] than the natives in Pannonia.
[16:40 --> 16:42] Drusus was able to eventually push his armies
[16:42 --> 16:43] all the way to the Elbe,
[16:44 --> 16:46] but every winter he was forced to withdraw back
[16:46 --> 16:47] to the safety of Gaul.
[16:48 --> 16:50] When they faced Drusus in battle,
[16:50 --> 16:51] the Germans usually lost,
[16:52 --> 16:54] but that in no way led to anything resembling
[16:54 --> 16:55] an atmosphere of conquest.
[16:56 --> 16:58] Like the Romans themselves,
[16:58 --> 17:00] the Germans could lose all the battles in the world
[17:00 --> 17:02] and still never admit defeat.
[17:03 --> 17:07] In 9 AD, a Roman general named Publius Varus
[17:07 --> 17:09] would make the mistake of thinking the Germans
[17:09 --> 17:11] had conquered people and lead three legions
[17:11 --> 17:13] into a disaster that would see the Romans
[17:13 --> 17:15] more or less withdraw from Germania forever,
[17:16 --> 17:19] the dream of a border on the Elbe River abandoned.
[17:21 --> 17:23] Disaster struck the royal family,
[17:23 --> 17:24] and really, that's what they were,
[17:24 --> 17:28] a royal family, in the late summer of 9 BC,
[17:28 --> 17:30] when Drusus fell off of his horse.
[17:31 --> 17:32] He'd been winding down a successful year
[17:32 --> 17:34] in the consulship and was preparing
[17:34 --> 17:36] to take on proconsular authority
[17:36 --> 17:38] and follow his brother up the chain of command,
[17:39 --> 17:42] but just like that, his career and his life
[17:42 --> 17:43] were cut short.
[17:44 --> 17:46] The injuries he sustained from the fall
[17:46 --> 17:47] likely became infected,
[17:47 --> 17:49] and he was simply unable to recover.
[17:50 --> 17:52] In a touching tribute to the bond
[17:52 --> 17:53] shared by the brothers,
[17:53 --> 17:57] Tiberius raced across 200 miles of hostile territory
[17:57 --> 17:59] accompanied by a single Gallic guide
[17:59 --> 18:00] when he heard the news.
[18:01 --> 18:03] Unlike Augustus racing to meet Agrippa,
[18:03 --> 18:05] Tiberius was able to make it in time,
[18:05 --> 18:06] but just barely.
[18:07 --> 18:08] Soon after his brother's arrival,
[18:09 --> 18:09] Drusus died.
[18:11 --> 18:12] Tiberius led the body back to Rome
[18:12 --> 18:15] and was soon joined by Augustus and Livia,
[18:15 --> 18:16] who was beside herself with grief
[18:16 --> 18:18] at the loss of her son.
[18:19 --> 18:21] As I said, Antonia never remarried.
[18:21 --> 18:23] She moved in with Augustus and Livia,
[18:23 --> 18:25] and her children were raised alongside
[18:25 --> 18:28] their older cousins, Gaius and Lucius.
[18:29 --> 18:32] The next year brought only more bad news for Augustus.
[18:33 --> 18:35] Messinus, his longtime friend
[18:35 --> 18:37] and key political advisor during the rise to power,
[18:38 --> 18:41] died in October, leaving Augustus alone at the top.
[18:42 --> 18:45] There is something indispensable about advisors
[18:45 --> 18:47] who are around before power is won,
[18:48 --> 18:49] who can speak plainly and directly
[18:49 --> 18:51] without succumbing to awe.
[18:52 --> 18:54] Augustus was fast running out of such men,
[18:55 --> 18:57] and the two most important were now dead.
[18:58 --> 19:00] Augustus, for so long the young man
[19:00 --> 19:02] fighting his elders for power,
[19:02 --> 19:03] was now himself the elder,
[19:04 --> 19:05] surrounded by younger men
[19:05 --> 19:06] whose relationship to him
[19:06 --> 19:09] was inalterably colored by his supreme power.
[19:11 --> 19:13] Augustus was never lonely or lacking for company,
[19:14 --> 19:16] but at this point, the only person left
[19:16 --> 19:19] who resembled both a friend and an equal was Livia.
[19:21 --> 19:23] There was much speculation about why he remained with her
[19:23 --> 19:25] after it became apparent that their marriage
[19:25 --> 19:26] would never produce children,
[19:27 --> 19:30] but perhaps she gave him access to an easy familiarity
[19:30 --> 19:33] that he would be unable to find anywhere else.
[19:34 --> 19:36] File that under pure speculation, though.
[19:37 --> 19:39] With Agrippa and Drusus dead,
[19:40 --> 19:42] the only man ready to step into power now,
[19:42 --> 19:44] should Augustus die, was Tiberius.
[19:45 --> 19:48] Probably out of consideration for this fact,
[19:48 --> 19:50] Tiberius was promoted to a status
[19:50 --> 19:52] not unlike that attained by Agrippa
[19:52 --> 19:55] after Augustus's brush with death in 23 BC.
[19:56 --> 19:59] After taking over his brother's command in Germania,
[19:59 --> 20:01] he served his consul in 7 BC,
[20:01 --> 20:03] and was then granted the same power
[20:03 --> 20:05] of the tribunate that Augustus enjoyed.
[20:06 --> 20:08] Once his year in the consulship was over,
[20:09 --> 20:11] Augustus had slated Tiberius to head east
[20:11 --> 20:14] and oversee another intervention into Armenia,
[20:14 --> 20:17] where a pro-Parthian monarch had recently ascended the throne.
[20:18 --> 20:22] But Tiberius shocked everyone when he suddenly announced
[20:22 --> 20:23] that he would be doing no such thing,
[20:24 --> 20:27] that, in fact, he was retiring from public life for good.
[20:29 --> 20:31] Historians, both ancient and modern,
[20:31 --> 20:34] have puzzled over Tiberius's inexplicable retirement.
[20:35 --> 20:38] Some posit that he could see plainly
[20:38 --> 20:40] that he was simply a temporary placeholder,
[20:40 --> 20:42] that he would be forced to step aside
[20:42 --> 20:44] for Gaius and Lucius eventually,
[20:44 --> 20:46] so why waste his life clearing the way
[20:46 --> 20:48] for his younger stepbrothers?
[20:49 --> 20:50] Others say that he actually had
[20:50 --> 20:52] the teenager's best interests at heart,
[20:52 --> 20:54] and was removing himself from this stage
[20:54 --> 20:56] so there would be no competition
[20:56 --> 20:57] for the public's attention.
[20:58 --> 21:00] And, of course, on a more personal level,
[21:01 --> 21:02] everyone likes to point out how unhappy
[21:02 --> 21:05] the marriage between Tiberius and Julia was,
[21:05 --> 21:07] and that when he retired,
[21:07 --> 21:10] he was retiring as much from her as he was from politics.
[21:11 --> 21:13] Whatever the real reason, in 6 BC,
[21:14 --> 21:16] the one man Augustus would feel comfortable
[21:16 --> 21:19] turning over the empire to, walked away from him.
[21:21 --> 21:23] Augustus was enraged by his stepson's betrayal,
[21:23 --> 21:25] and when the princeps announced
[21:25 --> 21:26] Tiberius's decision to the Senate,
[21:27 --> 21:28] his remarks made it very clear
[21:28 --> 21:30] that he was taking the whole thing personally.
[21:32 --> 21:33] But despite the heavy pressure
[21:33 --> 21:34] exerted on him to reconsider,
[21:35 --> 21:37] Tiberius packed his bags and sailed for Rhodes,
[21:38 --> 21:40] the island he had chosen for his self-imposed ex-wife.
[21:41 --> 21:44] It's hard to tell what to make of the episode.
[21:44 --> 21:45] Did Tiberius really think
[21:45 --> 21:47] he was leaving public life behind,
[21:47 --> 21:49] or was it all some elaborate charade
[21:49 --> 21:52] designed to prove how indispensable he was?
[21:52 --> 21:54] To partially answer the question,
[21:54 --> 21:56] I think we can look to the fact
[21:56 --> 21:58] that while Tiberius gave up formal office
[21:58 --> 21:59] when he left for Rhodes,
[22:00 --> 22:02] he conspicuously did not give back
[22:02 --> 22:04] the at-large powers the Senate had bestowed upon him.
[22:05 --> 22:07] One suspects that Tiberius
[22:07 --> 22:09] was not done with politics just yet.
[22:12 --> 22:15] Tiberius's announcement left Augustus in a bind.
[22:15 --> 22:19] Gaius and Lucius, at this point, were only 14 and 11.
[22:19 --> 22:22] If the princeps died, who would take over?
[22:22 --> 22:23] Because they certainly weren't ready.
[22:24 --> 22:27] Tiberius could always be returned from retirement,
[22:27 --> 22:29] but this whole self-imposed exile thing
[22:29 --> 22:31] would make it very difficult to arrange
[22:31 --> 22:33] for a peaceful transfer of power.
[22:34 --> 22:36] If Tiberius was still retired when Augustus died,
[22:37 --> 22:40] other ambitious men would seize on the opportunity
[22:40 --> 22:42] to lay their own claim on the throne.
[22:43 --> 22:44] Since that certainly wouldn't do,
[22:45 --> 22:46] Augustus was left with no other choice.
[22:47 --> 22:48] He simply had to keep living.
[22:49 --> 22:50] One way or the other,
[22:50 --> 22:52] he would have to stay alive long enough
[22:52 --> 22:54] to see Gaius and Lucius come of age
[22:54 --> 22:57] and establish a place in Roman public life for themselves.
[22:59 --> 23:02] Next week, fate will continue to mock
[23:02 --> 23:04] Augustus's plan for a permanent dynasty.
[23:05 --> 23:07] While the princeps focused on outliving
[23:07 --> 23:08] the childhoods of his two grandsons,
[23:08 --> 23:11] he was not prepared to outlive them completely.
[23:12 --> 23:13] But when death came calling,
[23:14 --> 23:16] first for Lucius and then for Gaius,
[23:16 --> 23:18] the princeps could only stand by helplessly
[23:18 --> 23:21] as his young heirs were stolen away from him.
[23:22 --> 23:25] To make matters worse, by the time the two boys died,
[23:25 --> 23:27] Augustus had already banished Julia from Rome
[23:27 --> 23:29] when somebody finally told him
[23:29 --> 23:31] what she had been up to all these years.
[23:32 --> 23:34] With his only daughter wasting away in exile
[23:34 --> 23:36] and his two prized grandsons dead,
[23:36 --> 23:38] the family Augustus had worked so hard
[23:38 --> 23:41] to build and protect was now in shambles.
[23:42 --> 23:45] The Julian line could no longer stand on its own two feet.
[23:45 --> 23:47] It would need a transfusion of blood
[23:47 --> 23:49] from the Claudians to survive.
[23:51 --> 23:54] Before we go, I would like to take a personal moment here
[23:54 --> 23:56] as today is Mother's Day in the United States.
[23:57 --> 23:59] Mom, I know you're like three episodes behind the pace,
[23:59 --> 24:02] so this won't get to you for another week or two.
[24:02 --> 24:03] But wherever you are,
[24:03 --> 24:04] probably trucking around the neighborhood,
[24:04 --> 24:06] happy Mother's Day.
[24:06 --> 24:07] I love you.

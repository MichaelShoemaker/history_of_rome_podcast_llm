[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, Episode 23A, The War with Hannibal.
[00:13 --> 00:17] Rome had laid its ultimatum at the feet of the Carthaginian Senate after Hannibal had
[00:17 --> 00:19] laid siege to Saguntum in Spain.
[00:20 --> 00:24] If the Carthaginians did not immediately recall Hannibal from the field and cease
[00:24 --> 00:27] their aggressive operations, Rome would declare war.
[00:28 --> 00:32] The Carthaginians declined to do as the Romans asked, and both sides immediately
[00:32 --> 00:38] began to prepare for battle. The Roman consuls for the year, Cornelius Scipio,
[00:38 --> 00:44] father of the famous Scipio Africanus, and Sempranius Longus, began to raise
[00:44 --> 00:47] legions with the intention of simultaneously attacking both Spain and
[00:47 --> 00:50] North Africa. But in Spain,
[00:50 --> 00:54] Hannibal was making preparations of his own that would throw the Roman war
[00:54 --> 01:00] plan into complete disarray. He formulated a bold strategy to break the Romans by
[01:00 --> 01:04] way of a direct invasion of Italy. The Romans were worried about Gallic
[01:04 --> 01:08] opportunism on their northern border, but did not anticipate a full-fledged
[01:08 --> 01:13] Carthaginian invasion at all. Hannibal amassed a force of 90,000
[01:13 --> 01:18] infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 67 war elephants at New Carthage, and in
[01:18 --> 01:24] the middle of 218 BC, set out on a campaign that would ultimately last 17 years.
[01:25 --> 01:30] His first task was to simply make it out of Spain. The Carthaginians only
[01:30 --> 01:33] controlled about half the country, and the march to the Pyrenees was a
[01:33 --> 01:37] difficult one. Hannibal had no time for prolonged sieges, and was forced
[01:37 --> 01:41] to directly assault the cities he passed, suffering heavy casualties as a
[01:41 --> 01:46] result. Before passing into modern-day France, Hannibal released the
[01:46 --> 01:50] most reliable elements of his Spanish infantry, and passed into Gall with a
[01:50 --> 01:55] force of about 50,000. In Rome, Hannibal's movements passed without notice.
[01:56 --> 01:59] Sempranius Longus was in Sicily preparing a fleet for the invasion
[01:59 --> 02:04] of Africa, and Scipio was in North Italy raising a fleet of his own for
[02:04 --> 02:08] the attack on Spain, neither suspecting that in a matter of months
[02:08 --> 02:15] they would both be fighting for their lives in the icy sleet of the
[02:15 --> 02:19] legions, and after five days at sea, put into port at Massilia on the
[02:19 --> 02:23] eastern banks of the Rhone River. As soon as he put in, though, he received
[02:23 --> 02:27] word that not only had Hannibal broken out of Spain, but he had already
[02:27 --> 02:30] reached the Rhone himself, and was just a few miles up the road.
[02:31 --> 02:34] Scipio was shocked by this development, and immediately sent a
[02:34 --> 02:38] cavalry unit out to investigate. Sure enough, they found Hannibal on the
[02:38 --> 02:42] west bank of the river. A light skirmish of no consequence ensued
[02:42 --> 02:45] that served only to alert Hannibal to the fact that the Romans were now
[02:45 --> 02:50] officially on to him. He moved with all haste to cross the thousand yard
[02:50 --> 02:53] wide river, and was not helped by the army of angry Gauls on the
[02:53 --> 02:56] opposite shore, who were not inclined to allow this foreign army into
[02:56 --> 03:01] their territory. But Hannibal, flashing the first signs of his
[03:01 --> 03:04] tactical brilliance, lured the Gauls into a trap, and broke them
[03:04 --> 03:09] apart with little difficulty. The way clear, he quickly crossed the
[03:09 --> 03:12] remainder of his army, and marched on towards the Alps, which
[03:12 --> 03:14] were the only thing standing between him and Italy.
[03:16 --> 03:19] When Scipio arrived with his legions, the fires of the Carthaginian
[03:19 --> 03:24] camp were still smoldering, but the army was gone. The consul decided
[03:24 --> 03:27] against a pursuit, which would have taken his two legions into an
[03:27 --> 03:31] unknown and unfriendly territory to catch a much larger Carthaginian
[03:31 --> 03:35] army. The odds were against Scipio, so he made the decision
[03:35 --> 03:38] to send the legions on to their initial objective in Spain, while
[03:38 --> 03:41] he himself returned to Italy to brace the northern border for
[03:41 --> 03:45] Hannibal's invasion. The Roman plan to fight the war in Spain
[03:45 --> 03:49] and Africa would move forward, but Scipio knew that the war
[03:49 --> 03:52] was about to reach an early decisive moment, and wanted to
[03:52 --> 03:57] be on hand to ensure a favorable outcome. Hannibal's
[03:57 --> 03:59] passage through the Alps is one of the most famous events in
[03:59 --> 04:03] world history, and with good reason. Not only did the 15
[04:03 --> 04:07] day crossing come as the snow was beginning to set in,
[04:07 --> 04:09] making traversing the peaks difficult and nearly impossible,
[04:10 --> 04:13] but Hannibal's army was forced to constantly fend off bands
[04:13 --> 04:17] of hostile natives. The passage would have been hard enough
[04:17 --> 04:21] in a small, self-contained party, but Hannibal had to oversee
[04:21 --> 04:25] 50,000 men and a supply train of pack animals. And did I
[04:25 --> 04:29] mention that he had 67 elephants in tow? The logistical
[04:29 --> 04:31] nightmares alone were enough to dissuade even the most daring
[04:31 --> 04:35] of generals from even contemplating the attempt, and that's why
[04:35 --> 04:39] the Romans were in disbelief when reports began to arrive that
[04:39 --> 04:41] a Carthaginian army would shortly be emerging from the
[04:41 --> 04:45] mountains. Hannibal fought one major pitch battle against the
[04:45 --> 04:49] Gauls near the summit, and on the descent was forced to
[04:49 --> 04:52] literally carve a path out of the rocks to accommodate the
[04:52 --> 04:55] pack animals and elephants. His men spent nights simply
[04:55 --> 04:58] huddled around each other on the ground, trying not to
[04:58 --> 05:02] drop dead from exhaustion or freeze to death. Supplies were
[05:02 --> 05:05] low, and hunger was high, but through it all, the personal
[05:05 --> 05:10] magnetism of Hannibal kept his army together. For the most
[05:10 --> 05:13] part, anyway, the army that emerged on the far side had
[05:13 --> 05:17] been considerably reduced in numbers. Entering with 50,000,
[05:18 --> 05:21] they came out the other side with a mere 25,000 remaining.
[05:22 --> 05:25] A considerable chunk of those lost were casualties of the
[05:25 --> 05:28] environment and is a testament to how difficult the
[05:28 --> 05:31] journey really was, but the majority were almost certainly
[05:31 --> 05:34] deserters. Apparently, the force of Hannibal's personality
[05:34 --> 05:39] was only so strong. Hannibal was able to briefly rest his
[05:39 --> 05:43] troops, but the two Roman legions ostensibly in place to
[05:43 --> 05:45] ward off the Gauls were on their way with Scipio at
[05:45 --> 05:49] their head. It would not be long before the war would
[05:49 --> 05:52] begin in earnest. The Romans had pressed for the war
[05:52 --> 05:54] and were chomping at the bit to take on the
[05:54 --> 05:57] Carthaginians, but, at least initially, the Second
[05:57 --> 06:00] Punic War turned out to be a series of shocking defeats
[06:00 --> 06:05] for Rome. The first battle was fought on the banks of
[06:05 --> 06:08] the Ticinus, the largest tributary of the Po River.
[06:09 --> 06:12] Scipio, eager to engage the invading Carthaginians, built
[06:12 --> 06:15] a bridge across the river and crossed over to meet
[06:15 --> 06:19] Hannibal. In the battle that ensued, the Romans matched
[06:19 --> 06:21] up just fine with their infantry, but their cavalry
[06:21 --> 06:24] was woefully inadequate in the face of their far
[06:24 --> 06:28] superior Numidian counterparts. The Romans were outflanked
[06:28 --> 06:30] driven back to the bridge they had built. In the
[06:30 --> 06:34] withdrawal, Scipio himself was wounded and was saved
[06:34 --> 06:37] either by a slave girl or, as Livy recounts, his
[06:37 --> 06:41] eighteen-year-old son, Scipio Africanus. Whether the
[06:41 --> 06:44] younger Scipio saved his father or not is debatable,
[06:44 --> 06:46] but there is no doubt that he was at the battle
[06:46 --> 06:49] that opened the war he would ultimately win sixteen
[06:49 --> 06:53] years later. The Romans crossed back over the bridge
[06:53 --> 06:55] and burned it to prevent the Carthaginians from
[06:55 --> 06:58] pursuing. Scipio's goal had been to stop the invasion
[06:58 --> 07:01] right then and there, but all he accomplished was
[07:01 --> 07:03] demonstrating to the local Gauls that Hannibal was
[07:03 --> 07:06] for real and caused them to begin actively
[07:06 --> 07:10] supporting the Carthaginian general. Scipio returned
[07:10 --> 07:12] to his base on the far side of the north-south
[07:12 --> 07:15] running Trebia River and sent out the call for
[07:15 --> 07:19] reinforcements. Hannibal did not immediately press his
[07:19 --> 07:21] advantage, but instead used the breathing space he
[07:21 --> 07:24] had won for himself to reprovision, rest his
[07:24 --> 07:27] exhausted troops, and accept Gallic reinforcements
[07:27 --> 07:30] into his ranks. Sempranius Longus was called from
[07:30 --> 07:33] his yet-to-be-launched invasion and ordered to
[07:33 --> 07:35] take his army north to join with Scipio and
[07:35 --> 07:39] engage Hannibal. It would be another decade plus
[07:39 --> 07:41] before the Romans revisited the idea of invading
[07:41 --> 07:46] Africa. The next month, Longus arrived with his
[07:46 --> 07:48] army and combined it with the existing troops.
[07:49 --> 07:52] Scipio cautioned rushing out into battle, having
[07:52 --> 07:55] seen firsthand what a devastating force Hannibal
[07:55 --> 07:58] was in the field. But Longus, impatient and no
[07:58 --> 08:00] doubt suspecting that his colleagues' injuries
[08:00 --> 08:02] were behind his wariness for further battle,
[08:03 --> 08:05] ordered the legions out to find and destroy the
[08:05 --> 08:08] Carthaginians. It was now December and the
[08:08 --> 08:11] weather had turned from bad to worse. Wind,
[08:12 --> 08:15] sleet, snow, and rain combined in a mixture of
[08:15 --> 08:17] all the worst possible conditions you can
[08:17 --> 08:19] imagine. The kind of weather that makes you
[08:19 --> 08:21] not even want to check your mail, let alone
[08:21 --> 08:24] fight a war. But Sempronius Longus was
[08:24 --> 08:27] determined to end the invasion before the next
[08:27 --> 08:30] consular elections. And just as in the case
[08:30 --> 08:33] with Regulus in the First Punic War, the
[08:33 --> 08:35] pressing need for battle was driven more by
[08:35 --> 08:37] personal vanity than careful calculation.
[08:38 --> 08:41] Hannibal played the Romans like a fiddle and
[08:41 --> 08:43] he manipulated Longus into a battle in which
[08:43 --> 08:45] the legions were in the worst possible
[08:45 --> 08:48] position to win. Catching wind of the change
[08:48 --> 08:50] in leadership and the impatience of the newly
[08:50 --> 08:53] arrived consul, Hannibal baited the Romans
[08:53 --> 08:56] into a trap. Early in the morning of a
[08:56 --> 08:58] particularly horrible day, Hannibal sent out a
[08:58 --> 09:00] large contingent of his cavalry to attack
[09:00 --> 09:03] the Roman camp. As soon as they appeared,
[09:04 --> 09:05] Longus ordered the full force of his
[09:05 --> 09:09] infantry out in pursuit. This hasty decision
[09:09 --> 09:10] left the Romans without something Hannibal
[09:10 --> 09:13] had hoped to deny them, a good warm
[09:13 --> 09:16] breakfast. The Romans essentially rolled out
[09:16 --> 09:19] of bed and charged off to fight. Compounding
[09:19 --> 09:21] their hunger, Longus ordered them to
[09:21 --> 09:23] immediately cross the Trebia, which in
[09:23 --> 09:25] December is a swollen and freezing river.
[09:26 --> 09:28] When they reached the other side, they
[09:28 --> 09:30] found Hannibal waiting for them at the
[09:30 --> 09:33] head of a well-fed dry army. And as if
[09:33 --> 09:35] this wasn't bad enough, Hannibal had
[09:35 --> 09:37] hidden a thousand cavalry behind an
[09:37 --> 09:40] outcrop of rocks and brush. The
[09:40 --> 09:42] Carthaginians drew the soaking and
[09:42 --> 09:43] exhausted Romans away from the river,
[09:43 --> 09:45] and as soon as there was enough space,
[09:46 --> 09:47] Hannibal ordered the hidden troops onto
[09:47 --> 09:50] the Roman rear. The battle was an
[09:50 --> 09:53] unmitigated disaster for Rome. The only
[09:53 --> 09:54] thing that allowed them to even
[09:54 --> 09:56] salvage their dignity was the
[09:56 --> 09:57] unquestioned superiority of the
[09:57 --> 10:01] legions as a fighting force. About 10,000
[10:01 --> 10:02] managed to break through the
[10:02 --> 10:03] Carthaginian line and make for
[10:03 --> 10:06] Placentia, but the rest of the army was
[10:06 --> 10:08] destroyed, either caught between the
[10:08 --> 10:10] two Carthaginian lines or killed
[10:10 --> 10:11] trying to re-cross the Trebia.
[10:13 --> 10:14] Sempronius Longus escaped with his
[10:14 --> 10:16] life, but left his reputation lying
[10:16 --> 10:18] dead on the battlefield.
[10:20 --> 10:22] Rome was now in a complete panic.
[10:22 --> 10:24] According to the frantic rumors, the
[10:24 --> 10:26] Carthaginians would become pouring
[10:26 --> 10:28] into the city in a matter of days,
[10:28 --> 10:30] and nothing could stop them. But
[10:30 --> 10:31] luckily, the winter,
[10:32 --> 10:33] despite Hannibal's cunning use of the
[10:33 --> 10:34] weather to his advantage,
[10:35 --> 10:36] was no time to launch a siege of
[10:36 --> 10:39] Rome. And besides, launching a siege of
[10:39 --> 10:41] Rome was not what Hannibal had in
[10:41 --> 10:41] mind anyway.
[10:42 --> 10:44] The Carthaginian army settled in for
[10:44 --> 10:45] the winter, and the war was put on
[10:45 --> 10:47] hold until the following spring.
[10:49 --> 10:51] When spring arrived, the Romans raised
[10:51 --> 10:53] fresh legions and sent them out to
[10:53 --> 10:55] man the frontier and prevent Hannibal
[10:55 --> 10:56] from making it any further south.
[10:58 --> 10:59] The dominant consul for the year was
[10:59 --> 11:00] Gaius Flaminius,
[11:01 --> 11:03] a popular plebeian leader whose only
[11:03 --> 11:05] major flaw was a maverick streak
[11:05 --> 11:06] that did not endear him to the
[11:06 --> 11:08] leading aristocrats,
[11:08 --> 11:10] or, by some accounts, to the gods of
[11:10 --> 11:11] Rome.
[11:12 --> 11:14] When Flaminius was elected in 217,
[11:14 --> 11:16] he did not return to Rome to oversee
[11:16 --> 11:18] the religious ceremonies that
[11:18 --> 11:19] accompanied the transfer of power,
[11:20 --> 11:22] which speaks either to his noble
[11:22 --> 11:24] disdain for the trappings of power,
[11:24 --> 11:26] or a foolish irreverence that would
[11:26 --> 11:27] lose him the favor of the gods.
[11:29 --> 11:31] Whether it was luck, stupidity, or
[11:31 --> 11:33] the active intervention of displeased
[11:33 --> 11:34] gods,
[11:34 --> 11:35] Flaminius was about to lead the
[11:35 --> 11:37] legions to their greatest defeat,
[11:38 --> 11:39] a defeat that shook the Romans to
[11:39 --> 11:40] their very core,
[11:40 --> 11:42] and would leave them almost insane
[11:42 --> 11:43] with fear.
[11:44 --> 11:46] Luckily for Flaminius's legacy, though,
[11:46 --> 11:48] the Battle of Lake Trasimene would
[11:48 --> 11:50] only stand as the worst defeat in
[11:50 --> 11:51] Roman history for a year,
[11:52 --> 11:54] and Flaminius's failure would be
[11:54 --> 11:56] overshadowed by Varro's far greater
[11:56 --> 11:58] display of incompetence at Cannae.
[12:00 --> 12:02] Sticking to his strategy of picking
[12:02 --> 12:03] the most difficult routes of
[12:03 --> 12:04] approach
[12:04 --> 12:05] in order to surprise his enemy,
[12:06 --> 12:08] Hannibal began 217 BC
[12:08 --> 12:09] by marching through a swamp.
[12:11 --> 12:13] The Romans had the roads covered, so
[12:13 --> 12:14] Hannibal simply abandoned them.
[12:15 --> 12:17] The four-day march through the flooded
[12:17 --> 12:19] slog was an understandably miserable
[12:19 --> 12:20] experience,
[12:20 --> 12:22] and in many ways was more difficult
[12:22 --> 12:23] than the passage through the Alps.
[12:24 --> 12:26] There was literally no dry ground
[12:26 --> 12:28] anywhere, and sleeping was a matter of
[12:28 --> 12:29] sitting in muddy water
[12:29 --> 12:32] and trying not to drown. Hannibal
[12:32 --> 12:32] brought up the rear,
[12:33 --> 12:35] riding an elephant, and making sure that
[12:35 --> 12:36] the army understood
[12:36 --> 12:38] the only way to move was forward.
[12:39 --> 12:41] The general shared the pain of his men,
[12:41 --> 12:42] though, his eyes having succumbed to
[12:42 --> 12:44] an infection that would eventually lead
[12:44 --> 12:46] to the removal of one of them.
[12:48 --> 12:50] But because of the horrid swamp march,
[12:51 --> 12:52] Hannibal accomplished his goal
[12:52 --> 12:54] and successfully outmaneuvered the
[12:54 --> 12:54] Romans.
[12:55 --> 12:57] He was now deep in Atruria, and no
[12:57 --> 12:59] army stood between the Carthaginians
[12:59 --> 12:59] and Rome.
[13:00 --> 13:02] Flaminius had no doubt that
[13:02 --> 13:03] Hannibal's goal was to march
[13:03 --> 13:04] uncontested on Rome,
[13:05 --> 13:06] and immediately sent out at double
[13:06 --> 13:08] time to catch the Carthaginians.
[13:09 --> 13:11] But Hannibal, as I said, had no
[13:11 --> 13:12] intention of attacking Rome,
[13:13 --> 13:15] but he did have every intention of
[13:15 --> 13:16] luring Flaminius into a trap,
[13:17 --> 13:19] and he chose Lake Trasimene as the
[13:19 --> 13:20] perfect site.
[13:22 --> 13:24] Lake Trasimene is about 150 miles north
[13:24 --> 13:25] of Rome,
[13:25 --> 13:26] and its northern bank butts up
[13:26 --> 13:27] against steep hills.
[13:29 --> 13:30] Hannibal placed his infantry on the
[13:30 --> 13:32] thin strip of land between the banks
[13:32 --> 13:34] and the hills, and waited for
[13:34 --> 13:36] Flaminius to come charging in the
[13:36 --> 13:37] narrow entrance to the north bank.
[13:39 --> 13:40] In the hills above and around the
[13:40 --> 13:42] bank, Hannibal hid his cavalry in a
[13:42 --> 13:44] good portion of his ground troops.
[13:45 --> 13:47] When Flaminius arrived, he passed
[13:47 --> 13:48] through the narrow entrance without a
[13:48 --> 13:49] second thought,
[13:50 --> 13:52] intent only on engaging Hannibal in
[13:52 --> 13:52] battle.
[13:53 --> 13:54] But as soon as his forces were
[13:54 --> 13:56] through, the Carthaginian cavalry
[13:56 --> 13:57] appeared
[13:57 --> 13:59] and sealed up the entrance, trapping
[13:59 --> 13:59] the Leidens.
[14:00 --> 14:02] Flaminius was caught completely by
[14:02 --> 14:04] surprise, and was just wrapping his
[14:04 --> 14:05] head around the fact that he was now
[14:05 --> 14:06] fighting on two fronts,
[14:07 --> 14:08] when the rest of the hidden
[14:08 --> 14:09] Carthaginian army came pouring down
[14:09 --> 14:10] slopes from above.
[14:11 --> 14:13] The Romans didn't stand a chance.
[14:14 --> 14:16] Of the 40,000 who entered, it is
[14:16 --> 14:18] estimated that 30,000 were killed or
[14:18 --> 14:18] captured,
[14:19 --> 14:20] including the ill-fated Gaius
[14:20 --> 14:21] Flaminius.
[14:22 --> 14:23] Many drowned in a vain attempt to
[14:23 --> 14:25] swim away from the slaughter.
[14:27 --> 14:29] Hannibal stood over the dead, and
[14:29 --> 14:30] must have wondered to himself how
[14:30 --> 14:32] the Romans could ever have conquered
[14:32 --> 14:32] anything.
[14:33 --> 14:35] Sure they were strong, but from what
[14:35 --> 14:37] Hannibal had seen over the last year,
[14:37 --> 14:39] they were about as savvy as a rock.
[14:40 --> 14:42] The way to beat the Romans, clearly,
[14:42 --> 14:44] was not to out-fight them, but to
[14:44 --> 14:45] out-think them.
[14:46 --> 14:47] Hannibal now held Italy in the palm
[14:47 --> 14:49] of his hand,
[14:49 --> 14:51] but his coup d'etat was yet to come.
[14:53 --> 14:55] Next week, we will begin with the
[14:55 --> 14:56] worst disaster in Roman military
[14:56 --> 14:57] history,
[14:57 --> 15:00] the Battle of Cannae. The Romans,
[15:00 --> 15:02] shocked by the succession of defeats
[15:02 --> 15:04] at the hand of this emerging national
[15:04 --> 15:05] nightmare called Hannibal,
[15:05 --> 15:08] will be left nearly catatonic when
[15:08 --> 15:09] they get word of what happened to the
[15:09 --> 15:10] legions at Cannae.

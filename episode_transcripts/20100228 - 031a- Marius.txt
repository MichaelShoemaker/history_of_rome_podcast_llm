[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 30A, Marius.
[00:12 --> 00:17] Last week we ended with the death of Gaius Gracchus, the popular reformer who was driven
[00:17 --> 00:19] to suicide in 121 BC.
[00:20 --> 00:25] This week we will take up the career of a man who coincidentally served as Tribune
[00:25 --> 00:27] of the Plebs the very next year.
[00:28 --> 00:33] He would not make his name in that office or that year, but twenty years later he would
[00:33 --> 00:37] be known to history as the great remaker of the Roman legions and the man who was
[00:37 --> 00:39] consul five times in a row.
[00:40 --> 00:44] With the Gracchus had started by flouting the laws against consecutive terms, Marius
[00:44 --> 00:47] took to a higher office for an even longer stay.
[00:49 --> 00:53] Gaius Marius was born in 157 BC in southern Latium.
[00:54 --> 00:58] His hometown had been conquered by the Romans in the fourth century BC and since that
[00:58 --> 01:01] time they had been citizens of Rome without voting rights.
[01:02 --> 01:06] It wasn't until about thirty years before Marius' birth that his people were granted
[01:06 --> 01:08] status as full Roman citizens.
[01:09 --> 01:12] The story goes that Marius was the son of a simple farmer.
[01:13 --> 01:17] But this myth of humble origins was an invention after the fact to help the
[01:17 --> 01:21] poor of Rome identify with Marius, the great general and politician.
[01:22 --> 01:26] His father was certainly involved in farming, but he was likely a major landowner
[01:26 --> 01:30] who had numerous familial and commercial ties to the nobility in Rome.
[01:31 --> 01:34] There is no other way to explain how Marius was able to get his foot in the
[01:34 --> 01:36] door to high Roman office.
[01:38 --> 01:42] The other great myth of Marius' early years was that as a teenager he came
[01:42 --> 01:45] across an eagle's nest with seven chicks inside.
[01:46 --> 01:49] Eagles were seen by the Romans as sacred animals looked after by Jupiter
[01:49 --> 01:50] himself.
[01:50 --> 01:54] Though again this myth did not begin making the rounds until years later,
[01:54 --> 01:59] especially after Marius began running for his seventh consulship and it was
[01:59 --> 02:03] impressed upon the people that had all been preordained by Jupiter himself.
[02:03 --> 02:07] Elect Marius, he once saw seven baby eagles and he's only been consul six
[02:07 --> 02:11] times. Get it? You don't want to go messing around with the universe,
[02:11 --> 02:11] do you?
[02:13 --> 02:17] When Marius came of age he volunteered for service in the army and was
[02:17 --> 02:18] placed as an officer.
[02:19 --> 02:23] Though this placement hints that his family was well connected, he was
[02:23 --> 02:25] never truly accepted by his noble peers.
[02:26 --> 02:31] To them, he would always be novice homo or a new man, meaning that none
[02:31 --> 02:33] of his ancestors had ever served as consul.
[02:34 --> 02:38] Despite all the power, wealth and fame he acquired over his career, to
[02:38 --> 02:40] the old guard he would always be a new man.
[02:41 --> 02:44] Much the way that in England, no matter what Margaret Thatcher did,
[02:44 --> 02:48] said or achieved, she will always be just a grocer's daughter to the
[02:48 --> 02:52] aristocratic class. Some ceiling simply cannot be broken through.
[02:53 --> 02:57] Though this very status as a new man would solidify Marius' near
[02:57 --> 03:00] sainthood in the eyes of other ambitious young men who could not
[03:00 --> 03:02] trace their family trees back to Romulus.
[03:04 --> 03:08] As a young man, Marius was stationed with Scipio Emileanus in,
[03:08 --> 03:12] wait for it, Numantia, just like our old friends the Grokai brothers.
[03:12 --> 03:18] In 134 BC, he ran for and was elected one of 24 military tribunes for
[03:18 --> 03:22] the Spanish legions. He was an unknown candidate but had a stellar
[03:22 --> 03:26] service record to present. Unable to trade on his name, Marius
[03:26 --> 03:29] traded on his skills and accomplishments. What a concept.
[03:31 --> 03:35] This began Marius' slow and sometimes agonizing climb of the
[03:35 --> 03:39] Roman political ladder. At each rung, he was resisted by the
[03:39 --> 03:43] who were never quick to embrace new men. So unlike many other
[03:43 --> 03:47] great figures in Roman history, his elections were never a
[03:47 --> 03:51] foregone conclusion. In 120 BC though, the year after Gaius
[03:51 --> 03:55] Gracchus' turbulent final term in office, Marius was elected
[03:55 --> 03:58] a tribune of the plebs. He was able to do this by
[03:58 --> 04:02] securing the blessing of a noble named Quintus Metellus.
[04:02 --> 04:05] Though only three years older than Marius, the Marii family
[04:05 --> 04:08] had long been clients to the Metellii family and the old
[04:08 --> 04:13] client patron dynamic played out. Once in office though,
[04:13 --> 04:16] Marius infuriated his patrons by helping pass an election
[04:16 --> 04:20] reform law the Metellii opposed. The bill, and I am not
[04:20 --> 04:24] making this up, required a narrowing of the passageways
[04:24 --> 04:27] electors walk down on their way to the ballot box to
[04:27 --> 04:29] prevent harassment by partisans for one side or the other.
[04:30 --> 04:34] The lofty ideals of democracy are often reliant on such
[04:34 --> 04:37] micromanagement. The price of freedom, it seems, is
[04:37 --> 04:42] eternal vigilance over the width of hallways. His
[04:42 --> 04:45] relationship with Metellus strained, Marius' career
[04:45 --> 04:49] stalled. Though after a few years, he stepped up another
[04:49 --> 04:51] rung and managed to get elected praetor despite
[04:51 --> 04:54] charges of ballot fraud. I guess it doesn't matter how
[04:54 --> 04:57] narrow a passageway is if the man walking down it is
[04:57 --> 05:01] going to cast 50 votes. Marius served in Spain with
[05:01 --> 05:04] some distinction for a few years and then returned to
[05:04 --> 05:08] where he married the aunt of yet born Julius Caesar. I
[05:08 --> 05:11] have to apologize for conflating Marius with Sina at
[05:11 --> 05:14] the end of last week's episode. Marius was Caesar's
[05:14 --> 05:18] uncle-in-law, not father-in-law. The marriage was
[05:18 --> 05:20] a boon to Marius' career and earned him a whole host
[05:20 --> 05:24] of new allies amongst the elite and around 110 BC he
[05:24 --> 05:28] even patched things up with his old patron Metellus. At
[05:28 --> 05:31] this point, I would like to shift gears before we move
[05:31 --> 05:33] into the next stage of Marius' life and give a
[05:33 --> 05:36] little background on where he and Metellus are headed.
[05:38 --> 05:42] In 119 BC, the son of Massinissa, the old Numidian
[05:42 --> 05:46] ally of Rome from the Punic Wars, passed away. He
[05:46 --> 05:49] left the kingdom to his two sons and a third
[05:49 --> 05:51] adopted son named Jugurtha, who was technically
[05:51 --> 05:55] the dead king's nephew. All three were grandsons
[05:55 --> 05:58] of the great Massinissa. Jugurtha did not like to
[05:58 --> 06:00] play nice with the other children, though, and
[06:00 --> 06:03] immediately set about running the other two out of
[06:03 --> 06:06] town. He assassinated one, but the other escaped
[06:06 --> 06:09] and fled to Rome. Concerned at the power struggle
[06:09 --> 06:11] in their client state and the economic
[06:11 --> 06:14] disruptions caused, the Romans sent a delegation
[06:14 --> 06:16] to find out what the trouble was all about.
[06:18 --> 06:20] When he was a young man, Jugurtha served in
[06:20 --> 06:23] Spain as a cavalryman alongside the Romans and
[06:23 --> 06:25] had noticed the most glaring weakness of the
[06:25 --> 06:28] legions, the ease with which its commanders
[06:28 --> 06:31] could be bribed. Military commanders at this
[06:31 --> 06:34] time, no longer fighting for survival, were clearly
[06:34 --> 06:37] in it for the money and prestige and saw no
[06:37 --> 06:39] important distinction between plundering by force
[06:39 --> 06:43] and accepting bribes not to plunder. In fact,
[06:43 --> 06:46] the latter seemed far more cost effective. Of
[06:46 --> 06:49] course, to the Romans, the idea of bribery was
[06:49 --> 06:51] officially morally reprehensible, but this fact
[06:51 --> 06:54] had little impact on commanders in the field.
[06:55 --> 06:57] So when the Roman commission came to adjudicate
[06:57 --> 07:00] the budding civil war in Numidia, Jugurtha
[07:00 --> 07:02] bribed them handsomely to decide the issue in his
[07:02 --> 07:04] favor, which they promptly did, being men of
[07:04 --> 07:08] honor. Left alone and in control of half the
[07:08 --> 07:11] kingdom, Jugurtha set about attacking his cousin
[07:11 --> 07:14] brother to win the other half. In this
[07:14 --> 07:16] struggle, the Italian merchants and citizens
[07:16 --> 07:19] came down almost universally against Jugurtha,
[07:19 --> 07:21] who was causing a lot of trouble and
[07:21 --> 07:24] disrupting trade. In retaliation, Jugurtha took
[07:24 --> 07:27] the provocative step of executing a number of
[07:27 --> 07:30] Italians in his custody. The Senate could not
[07:30 --> 07:33] stand by and let this go, so they sent an
[07:33 --> 07:35] army to deal with the upstart. But the Roman
[07:35 --> 07:38] armies were able to do little against Jugurtha,
[07:38 --> 07:41] suspiciously little. At once, an investigation
[07:41 --> 07:44] was undertaken into accusations of bribery,
[07:44 --> 07:46] and Jugurtha, still technically a client of
[07:46 --> 07:48] Rome, was summoned to account for himself.
[07:50 --> 07:52] But a few well-placed bribes later, Jugurtha
[07:52 --> 07:54] was on his way back to Numidia, free as a
[07:54 --> 07:56] bird, and no finding of fault being handed
[07:56 --> 07:59] down on anyone. You gotta hand it to him,
[07:59 --> 08:01] there is something poetic about bribing your
[08:01 --> 08:03] way out of charges of bribery.
[08:05 --> 08:07] But the Roman people were still up in arms
[08:07 --> 08:10] about the barbarian king, and in 109 BC,
[08:10 --> 08:13] the consul for the year, Marius' old patron
[08:13 --> 08:15] Metellus, was sent to Numidia to put down
[08:15 --> 08:18] what had become a full-fledged rebellion.
[08:18 --> 08:21] He took along Marius to serve as chief
[08:21 --> 08:21] lieutenant.
[08:23 --> 08:26] The campaign was frustrating for both sides,
[08:26 --> 08:28] Metellus was too honest to be bribed, and
[08:28 --> 08:31] realizing this, Jugurtha kept to the mountains
[08:31 --> 08:32] and away from the invading legions.
[08:33 --> 08:36] The Numidians took a page from old Fabius
[08:36 --> 08:38] de Delaire, and embarked on a war of
[08:38 --> 08:40] attrition with the Romans. Metellus was
[08:40 --> 08:43] never able to pin the African prince down,
[08:43 --> 08:45] and his troops and the public back home
[08:45 --> 08:48] began to lose patience. Accusations of
[08:48 --> 08:50] bribery were hurled at Metellus, and
[08:50 --> 08:52] though innocent, his own perceived failure
[08:52 --> 08:53] became damning evidence.
[08:55 --> 08:57] Marius watched with frustration equaling
[08:57 --> 08:59] that of the Roman people. He thought
[08:59 --> 09:02] Metellus far too cautious, and began to
[09:02 --> 09:03] get the idea that he could do a better
[09:03 --> 09:06] job. To curry favor with the troops,
[09:06 --> 09:08] he relaxed discipline and camp, and
[09:08 --> 09:10] began letting it be known that if he
[09:10 --> 09:12] were in charge, this war would be over
[09:12 --> 09:12] in a week.
[09:14 --> 09:15] Troops and traders both began to
[09:15 --> 09:17] write home, praising Marius to the sky,
[09:17 --> 09:19] and a groundswell of support began to
[09:19 --> 09:21] coalesce around the confident lieutenant.
[09:23 --> 09:25] Marius asked permission to return home
[09:25 --> 09:27] and stand for the consulship. Metellus
[09:27 --> 09:29] disapproved of the idea, but knew the
[09:29 --> 09:31] troops were getting restless, and it
[09:31 --> 09:33] wouldn't do anyone any good to have
[09:33 --> 09:35] Marius sulking around camp stirring up
[09:35 --> 09:37] trouble. So the consul let him go.
[09:39 --> 09:41] Marius came back to Rome and
[09:41 --> 09:43] campaigned on a platform denouncing
[09:43 --> 09:44] the slow pace of Metellus' strategy.
[09:45 --> 09:47] He spoke confidently of his plan for
[09:47 --> 09:49] victory, which involved aggressive
[09:49 --> 09:53] tactics. The public, wary of corrupt
[09:53 --> 09:55] officials prolonging the war, swept
[09:55 --> 09:57] Marius into his first consulship in
[09:57 --> 10:00] 107 BC. The Senate was not exactly
[10:00 --> 10:02] pleased at the do-gooder Novus
[10:02 --> 10:04] Homo, who was about to spoil all
[10:04 --> 10:06] their fun, and while accepting his
[10:06 --> 10:08] election, attempted to deny his
[10:08 --> 10:09] appointment to command of the
[10:09 --> 10:12] Numidian legions. The People's
[10:12 --> 10:14] Assembly, however, countered the move
[10:14 --> 10:16] by invoking a little-known clause
[10:16 --> 10:18] that gave them final say over a
[10:18 --> 10:19] consul's placement in the field.
[10:20 --> 10:22] Marius was given Numidia and tasked
[10:22 --> 10:24] simply with following through on his
[10:24 --> 10:28] promise to end the war. To accomplish
[10:28 --> 10:30] this goal, Marius asked permission to
[10:30 --> 10:32] raise his own legions. This
[10:32 --> 10:34] permission was granted, but then
[10:34 --> 10:36] Marius asked for an exemption from
[10:36 --> 10:39] the rules governing recruitment. The
[10:39 --> 10:40] number of men who qualified under
[10:40 --> 10:42] the old census rules had dwindled to
[10:42 --> 10:44] a bare few, even after the
[10:44 --> 10:46] property qualifications had been
[10:46 --> 10:48] lowered and lowered again, until
[10:48 --> 10:49] they practically did not exist.
[10:51 --> 10:52] The army Marius raised for the
[10:52 --> 10:54] Numidian campaign, while the
[10:54 --> 10:56] logical conclusion of years of
[10:56 --> 10:58] rewriting the rules, nonetheless
[10:58 --> 10:59] marked a clear break with the past.
[11:01 --> 11:02] There would be no property
[11:02 --> 11:04] qualifications this time. Any
[11:04 --> 11:06] citizen was eligible, landowner or
[11:06 --> 11:08] not. The floodgates were open,
[11:09 --> 11:10] and the poor citizens of Rome
[11:10 --> 11:12] flocked to join Marius's new army.
[11:13 --> 11:15] Though the move was supposed to be
[11:15 --> 11:16] a temporary measure that affected
[11:16 --> 11:18] only this specific levy, there
[11:18 --> 11:21] was no turning back. Henceforth,
[11:21 --> 11:22] the ranks of the legions would
[11:22 --> 11:24] be filled by the poorest of the
[11:24 --> 11:25] poor, not the richest of the
[11:25 --> 11:28] rich. The elites had grown tired
[11:28 --> 11:29] of the burden of military
[11:29 --> 11:31] service anyway. They had plush
[11:31 --> 11:33] estates and Greek philosophy
[11:33 --> 11:35] to read. Let the rabble risk
[11:35 --> 11:37] their lives in the provinces. It
[11:37 --> 11:38] might clear off some of the
[11:38 --> 11:40] excess population, and besides, it
[11:40 --> 11:42] gave the poor something to do
[11:42 --> 11:43] besides railing against their
[11:43 --> 11:45] injustice of their lot in life,
[11:45 --> 11:47] which was becoming such a bore.
[11:48 --> 11:49] Let the beggars be soldiers,
[11:49 --> 11:51] whatever. It was a fateful
[11:51 --> 11:53] moment that greatly accelerated
[11:53 --> 11:54] the path to military
[11:54 --> 11:56] dictatorship and imperium.
[11:57 --> 11:58] From here on out, poor
[11:58 --> 12:00] citizens became career soldiers,
[12:00 --> 12:01] promised a salary while they
[12:01 --> 12:03] served, and a plot of land
[12:03 --> 12:05] when they retired. To most,
[12:05 --> 12:07] it seemed too good to be true,
[12:07 --> 12:08] and in many cases it was,
[12:09 --> 12:10] as the state reneged on land
[12:10 --> 12:12] grants and was often slow
[12:12 --> 12:14] with paychecks. Soon enough,
[12:15 --> 12:16] the interests of the soldiers no
[12:16 --> 12:17] longer aligned with the
[12:17 --> 12:19] interests of the state, and
[12:19 --> 12:20] generals who could deliver land
[12:20 --> 12:22] and pay gained the loyalty
[12:22 --> 12:23] of the men who now looked at
[12:23 --> 12:25] the Senate as a bunch of
[12:25 --> 12:27] crooked old liars. And we all
[12:27 --> 12:28] know where that road will take
[12:28 --> 12:31] us. But the immediate issue
[12:31 --> 12:32] was the war in Numidia.
[12:33 --> 12:35] Marius took his newly minted
[12:35 --> 12:36] soldiers to Africa and
[12:36 --> 12:37] promptly delivered on his
[12:37 --> 12:39] promise, though it wasn't
[12:39 --> 12:40] scorched earth brute force
[12:40 --> 12:42] carried the day, but rather
[12:42 --> 12:43] a little backroom treachery
[12:43 --> 12:46] of his own. After finding it
[12:46 --> 12:47] was not as easy to bottle up
[12:47 --> 12:49] Jagirtha as he thought,
[12:49 --> 12:50] Marius dispatched one of his
[12:50 --> 12:51] lieutenants to a neighboring
[12:51 --> 12:53] kingdom to convince the
[12:53 --> 12:55] local king, the father-in-law
[12:55 --> 12:56] of Jagirtha, to betray the
[12:56 --> 12:58] rebellious prince. Through a
[12:58 --> 13:00] mixture of bribery and
[13:00 --> 13:01] cajoling, the young
[13:01 --> 13:02] lieutenant was able to pull
[13:02 --> 13:03] it off, and the king
[13:03 --> 13:04] delivered Jagirtha to the
[13:04 --> 13:06] Roman delegation in chains.
[13:08 --> 13:09] Their general captured the
[13:09 --> 13:11] Numidian army surrendered.
[13:12 --> 13:13] Because he held imperium over
[13:13 --> 13:15] the war, Marius received all
[13:15 --> 13:16] the credit for his
[13:16 --> 13:18] lieutenant's actions. There
[13:18 --> 13:19] was nothing really improper
[13:19 --> 13:20] or unprecedented about this,
[13:21 --> 13:22] but it did stick in the
[13:22 --> 13:23] craw of the young officer,
[13:23 --> 13:25] who Marius failed often to
[13:25 --> 13:26] even mention as he
[13:26 --> 13:27] described how he won the
[13:27 --> 13:30] war. The incident would
[13:30 --> 13:31] mark the beginning of a
[13:31 --> 13:32] rift between Marius and the
[13:32 --> 13:34] young officer, a man named
[13:34 --> 13:37] Lucius Cornelius Sulla. That
[13:37 --> 13:38] rift would soon open up into
[13:38 --> 13:40] chasm, and the two men would
[13:40 --> 13:42] stand for years on opposite
[13:42 --> 13:43] sides of a bitter and often
[13:43 --> 13:45] bloody conflict that
[13:45 --> 13:46] presaged the full-blown civil
[13:46 --> 13:47] wars of the following
[13:47 --> 13:51] generation. But while Sulla's
[13:51 --> 13:52] star was still on the rise,
[13:53 --> 13:54] Marius was burning at its
[13:54 --> 13:56] absolute brightest. Next week,
[13:57 --> 13:58] he will check off baby eagles
[13:58 --> 14:00] two through six and break
[14:00 --> 14:01] every prohibition in the
[14:01 --> 14:03] book doing it, serving his
[14:03 --> 14:04] consul an unprecedented five
[14:04 --> 14:07] consecutive years. In that
[14:07 --> 14:09] time, he would fundamentally
[14:09 --> 14:10] reshape the organization and
[14:10 --> 14:12] composition of the legions,
[14:12 --> 14:13] turning them from a part-time
[14:13 --> 14:15] army into a fully
[14:15 --> 14:16] professional fighting force.
[14:17 --> 14:18] All the drilling and
[14:18 --> 14:19] conditioning Marius put his
[14:19 --> 14:21] armies through was essential
[14:21 --> 14:24] as, to the north, an old
[14:24 --> 14:25] menace was rising again.
[14:26 --> 14:27] Suddenly, the complacent
[14:27 --> 14:29] Romans, who had spent the
[14:29 --> 14:30] better part of a century
[14:30 --> 14:31] fighting wars of choice and
[14:31 --> 14:32] conquering the
[14:32 --> 14:33] Mediterranean with ease,
[14:33 --> 14:34] suddenly found themselves
[14:34 --> 14:36] facing a war of extinction.
[14:37 --> 14:38] The Gallic nightmare,
[14:38 --> 14:40] long dormant, was back with
[14:40 --> 14:41] a vengeance, and it would
[14:41 --> 14:42] take everything the Romans
[14:42 --> 14:43] had just to hold them at
[14:43 --> 14:45] bay, let alone conquer
[14:45 --> 14:45] anything.

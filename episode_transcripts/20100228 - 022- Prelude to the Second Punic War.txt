[00:04 --> 00:12] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 22, Prelude to the Second Punic War.
[00:13 --> 00:18] Rome and Carthage had spent the years after the first Punic War dealing with their own
[00:18 --> 00:22] problems and paying little official attention to one another, but the focus of the two
[00:22 --> 00:27] great powers would soon turn to each other once again and lead to a confrontation,
[00:27 --> 00:29] this time over Spain.
[00:30 --> 00:34] This confrontation would be the spark for what is arguably the most important period
[00:34 --> 00:37] in Roman history, the Second Punic War.
[00:39 --> 00:44] Entering the war, Rome was a regional power on the rise, but still recognizably the
[00:44 --> 00:49] same political entity that had emerged from the devastation of the Gallic Sack 170 years
[00:49 --> 00:49] before.
[00:50 --> 00:55] However, at the end of the war with Hannibal, a 20-year trial of immense physical and
[00:56 --> 01:01] endurance, Rome had transformed into the invincible juggernaut that would conquer
[01:01 --> 01:01] the Mediterranean.
[01:03 --> 01:07] Hannibal would prove to be Rome's most impressive enemy, and after surviving the
[01:07 --> 01:12] bold Carthaginian invasion of Italy, the Romans simply turned and steamrolled the
[01:12 --> 01:13] rest of the known world.
[01:14 --> 01:18] The importance of the Second Punic War is also measured by the fact that after
[01:18 --> 01:24] Scipio's final victory at Zama in 202 BC, Roman elites almost immediately began
[01:24 --> 01:27] to lament the loss of Roman virtue and nobility.
[01:28 --> 01:33] The total domination Rome had achieved after defeating Carthage allowed steadfast
[01:33 --> 01:36] frugality to be usurped by excessive debauchery.
[01:37 --> 01:40] Never again would the literati look at their contemporaries with anything but
[01:40 --> 01:45] contempt, and the idea that Rome had fallen from grace was, from that point on,
[01:46 --> 01:47] simply taken for granted.
[01:48 --> 01:52] It speaks volumes then of the impact the Second Punic War had on the Romans, that
[01:52 --> 01:56] it would essentially mark the close of an alleged golden age where all men were
[01:56 --> 02:01] clones of Cincinnatus and usher in a new, modern era where all men were corrupt,
[02:01 --> 02:04] hedonistic, and unworthy of their great ancestors.
[02:05 --> 02:08] But for now, Rome was still a paradigm of virtue.
[02:10 --> 02:14] While the Romans were focused elsewhere, dealing with the Gallic invasion and
[02:14 --> 02:18] Illyrian piracy, the Carthaginians began to quietly build an empire in
[02:18 --> 02:18] Spain.
[02:19 --> 02:24] Well, not the Carthaginians as a whole necessarily, just Hamilcar Baracca.
[02:25 --> 02:30] After being driven from Sicily, Hamilcar returned to Carthage and briefly stewed
[02:30 --> 02:34] in his juices before hatching a plan to revenge himself upon the Romans.
[02:35 --> 02:39] He knew that a direct assault on Rome would be a suicidal fool's errand, so
[02:39 --> 02:43] he looked instead to Spain for an opportunity to build up the wealth and
[02:43 --> 02:46] power necessary to re-engage the hated Romans.
[02:46 --> 02:51] He pitched the Carthaginian Senate on the idea of a Spanish invasion, couching
[02:51 --> 02:55] the benefits of such an adventure in economic terms, the opportunity for
[02:55 --> 02:58] traders to make up for the loss of Sicily, and the possibility of drawing
[02:58 --> 03:02] from Spanish resources to pay the war indemnity owed to the Romans.
[03:03 --> 03:07] The Senate was quick to approve Hamilcar's plan, as much to get the
[03:07 --> 03:10] disgruntled soldier out of Carthage as much as anything else.
[03:10 --> 03:14] It had been the Carthaginian Senate, after all, who had been the ones who
[03:14 --> 03:18] had left Hannibal twisting in the wind for so many years in Sicily, and
[03:18 --> 03:21] they were understandably anxious to get rid of the charismatic general.
[03:22 --> 03:26] So in 337 BC, without a navy to speak of,
[03:26 --> 03:29] Hamilcar marched his army west across North Africa and
[03:29 --> 03:31] crossed the Straits of Gibraltar into Spain.
[03:32 --> 03:36] The Iberian Peninsula was, at that time, populated with tribes whose
[03:36 --> 03:39] prowess on the battlefield was matched only by their lack of
[03:39 --> 03:40] political sophistication.
[03:41 --> 03:45] There were three broad tribal groups, the Iberians, the Celts, and
[03:45 --> 03:49] the Celtabarians, who were a co-mingled mix of the two races.
[03:49 --> 03:53] But to say that Spain was decentralized would be an understatement.
[03:54 --> 03:57] Not only were the tribes constantly at each other's throats, but
[03:57 --> 04:01] within tribes, individual settlements formed intense rivalries with their neighbors.
[04:02 --> 04:06] When Hamilcar embarked on his conquest, his task was made
[04:06 --> 04:10] immeasurably easier by the total lack of cooperation amongst the natives and
[04:10 --> 04:12] the willingness of the locals to join the Carthaginians,
[04:13 --> 04:15] if it meant getting the better of their neighbors.
[04:17 --> 04:21] Hamilcar set up a base just over the strait from Africa in southern Spain and
[04:21 --> 04:25] began to steadily grow Carthaginian influence over the peninsula.
[04:26 --> 04:29] Hamilcar, though, was not interested in simply conquering
[04:29 --> 04:31] Spain for the greater glory of Carthage.
[04:32 --> 04:35] He was intent on setting up an autonomous empire for himself.
[04:36 --> 04:39] Sure, his dispatch as home did not reflect this ambition, but
[04:39 --> 04:43] he clearly took steps to make the Baraka family the preeminent rulers of
[04:43 --> 04:47] the peninsula, not the Carthaginian government per se.
[04:48 --> 04:52] Hamilcar began to mint coins that associated himself and his son Hannibal
[04:52 --> 04:55] with the local patron god of the Iberian Peninsula, and
[04:55 --> 04:59] asked the army to swear allegiance to his family rather than the Carthaginian empire.
[05:00 --> 05:02] Hamilcar was laying the groundwork for
[05:02 --> 05:06] a quasi-divine dynasty in Spain that he hoped to pass on to his sons.
[05:08 --> 05:12] The Carthaginian Senate, for their part, left Hamilcar to his own devices.
[05:13 --> 05:15] They were happy to be rid of the ambitious general.
[05:15 --> 05:17] And as long as the cash kept rolling in,
[05:17 --> 05:21] they didn't care who a bunch of backwards tribesmen were worshiping.
[05:22 --> 05:25] Spain was an incredibly resource-rich territory and
[05:25 --> 05:27] produced massive quantities of high-grade silver.
[05:28 --> 05:32] There is no doubt that the silver mines were the prime attraction for
[05:32 --> 05:34] both Hamilcar and later the Romans.
[05:34 --> 05:38] It is an interesting historical parallel to note the similarity between
[05:38 --> 05:42] the Carthaginian and Roman exploitation of Spain, and
[05:42 --> 05:46] Spain's own exploitation of the New World 1,700 years later.
[05:47 --> 05:50] Both had the effect of flooding the markets of the world with vast amounts of
[05:50 --> 05:54] new wealth, and one wonders at the effect of having their own resources
[05:54 --> 05:58] violently stripped years before had on the Spanish decision
[05:58 --> 06:01] to seize South American gold mines with such vicious abandon.
[06:02 --> 06:05] Maybe there is no connection at all, but as I said,
[06:06 --> 06:08] it is at least an interesting coincidence that Spain,
[06:08 --> 06:12] of all places, was the New World of the Old World.
[06:14 --> 06:16] Hamilcar marched his armies out north and east,
[06:17 --> 06:19] taking possession of whatever territory he entered, and
[06:19 --> 06:22] soon commanded a large portion of southwest Spain.
[06:23 --> 06:26] In general, Hamilcar treated the native armies who resisted with
[06:26 --> 06:29] a combination of ruthlessness and leniency.
[06:30 --> 06:34] The leadership would be executed, but the troops themselves would be sent home.
[06:35 --> 06:38] Hamilcar was not looking to exterminate the Spanish, but to rule them.
[06:39 --> 06:43] His long-term plans centered around drawing from the vast pool of Spanish
[06:43 --> 06:45] infantry, if they could be called that,
[06:45 --> 06:49] to fill his army when he finally launched himself once again at the Romans.
[06:50 --> 06:53] There was no point in engendering the hatred of men he hoped to someday
[06:53 --> 06:56] lead, so soldiers were sent back to their families.
[06:57 --> 07:00] Rival centers of power, however, could not be tolerated, and
[07:00 --> 07:02] the chieftains were executed without a second thought.
[07:04 --> 07:09] In 231 BC, Rome began to take notice of what Hamilcar was up to and
[07:09 --> 07:10] sent envoys to investigate.
[07:11 --> 07:15] The Romans were caught up fighting the Gauls and the Illyrians, and
[07:15 --> 07:18] had no real desire to invest themselves in Spain as well.
[07:18 --> 07:20] So they were satisfied by the slick and
[07:20 --> 07:23] plausible message Hamilcar sent back to Rome.
[07:23 --> 07:27] I am merely trying to pay back our debt to you as quickly as possible.
[07:27 --> 07:29] Surely there is nothing wrong with that.
[07:30 --> 07:31] Slick, very slick.
[07:33 --> 07:34] The Romans thus hoodwinked.
[07:34 --> 07:37] Hamilcar went back to gathering the strength he needed to destroy them.
[07:39 --> 07:41] The great Carthaginian general, however,
[07:41 --> 07:44] would not get the chance to set Rome ablaze.
[07:44 --> 07:47] During the winter of 228 BC, after being surprised and
[07:47 --> 07:51] driven off by a tribal army, Hamilcar drowned while crossing
[07:51 --> 07:52] a treacherous river.
[07:53 --> 07:57] He was succeeded by his son-in-law, Hasdrubal, who immediately raised a force
[07:57 --> 08:01] of 50,000 and exterminated the tribe, who he blamed for Hamilcar's death.
[08:02 --> 08:04] After this initial show of force,
[08:04 --> 08:08] Hasdrubal settled back into the role more of governor than conqueror.
[08:09 --> 08:11] He did not try and build on the territory Hamilcar had won.
[08:12 --> 08:15] Rather, he consolidated Carthaginian holdings and
[08:15 --> 08:19] attempted to sink the new imperial dynasty into the Spanish psyche.
[08:20 --> 08:23] He made the tribal chiefs acclaim him their supreme ruler, and
[08:23 --> 08:26] murdered any who were even suspected of opposing him.
[08:27 --> 08:30] He founded a capital on the southern coast of the peninsula called New
[08:30 --> 08:34] Carthage, a virtually impregnable fortress from which he ruled.
[08:35 --> 08:37] Clearly, the Carthaginians were here to stay.
[08:39 --> 08:43] In 226 BC, the Romans began to worry again about the Carthaginian
[08:43 --> 08:44] presence in Spain.
[08:44 --> 08:47] They had allies on the peninsula themselves and
[08:47 --> 08:49] worried about North African encroachment.
[08:50 --> 08:54] A treaty was concluded with Hasdrubal to the effect that the Carthaginians
[08:54 --> 08:57] would not cross the river Ebro, which lies midway up the Mediterranean
[08:57 --> 08:58] coast of Spain.
[08:59 --> 09:02] This demarcation is important because it left Saguntum,
[09:03 --> 09:07] a city that was on friendly terms with Rome, 100 miles behind enemy lines.
[09:08 --> 09:12] But the expediency of preserving the peace with Carthage took precedence,
[09:12 --> 09:14] and the Romans agreed to stay on their side of the Ebro.
[09:16 --> 09:19] Five years later, Hasdrubal's heavy-handed rule caught up with him,
[09:19 --> 09:22] and he was assassinated by a disgruntled tribesman,
[09:22 --> 09:24] revenge for the murder of a chieftain.
[09:25 --> 09:28] Upon Hasdrubal's death, the army immediately called for
[09:28 --> 09:31] the ascension of Hannibal, Hamilcar's eldest son.
[09:32 --> 09:36] Only 25 at the time, Hannibal was elevated to a position of supreme
[09:36 --> 09:40] authority and did not waste any time plotting how to make good on the oath
[09:40 --> 09:44] he had sworn years before to make himself an enemy of Rome for eternity.
[09:46 --> 09:49] Hannibal was wildly popular amongst his troops.
[09:49 --> 09:54] Not only had he been fully integrated into the semi-divine cult his father had built,
[09:54 --> 09:57] but Hannibal had also grown up in the army camps and
[09:57 --> 10:00] was considered by the soldiers to be one of them.
[10:01 --> 10:04] It was the perfect combination to assure complete loyalty.
[10:05 --> 10:07] Not only did they respect him as a soldier and a man, but
[10:07 --> 10:08] they worshiped him as a god.
[10:10 --> 10:13] This loyalty would be tested over and over again, and it is one of the great
[10:13 --> 10:18] testaments to Hannibal's leadership that in all the years he kept his men in Italy,
[10:18 --> 10:22] fighting an increasingly hopeless war of attrition, that there is not a single
[10:22 --> 10:24] mention of a mutiny or an assassination attempt.
[10:25 --> 10:27] Not even Alexander can say that.
[10:29 --> 10:32] The son of Hamilcar picked up where his father left off and
[10:32 --> 10:36] began to claim new territory for Carthage, securing the northwest frontier
[10:36 --> 10:39] with a surprising efficiency that foreshadowed things to come.
[10:40 --> 10:43] Hannibal was no passive governor like his brother-in-law.
[10:43 --> 10:45] He was a conqueror of the First Order.
[10:46 --> 10:50] The city of Saguntum became increasingly worried by the young Carthaginian leader.
[10:51 --> 10:53] They had been left alone by Hasdrubal, but
[10:53 --> 10:56] Hannibal seemed to be cut from an entirely different cloth.
[10:57 --> 11:00] They sent pleas for aid over and over again to Rome, but
[11:00 --> 11:03] Roman eyes were turned east to Illyria and could not be bothered.
[11:04 --> 11:07] Finally, Saguntum kicked up enough of a fuss that the Romans sent
[11:07 --> 11:11] a mission to Spain to get a look at the new Carthaginian leader themselves
[11:11 --> 11:13] and take stock of the situation.
[11:14 --> 11:18] The Roman envoys did not like what they saw one bit and
[11:18 --> 11:21] came away convinced that war with the Carthaginians was imminent.
[11:21 --> 11:23] Though they believed any campaign would be limited to Spain.
[11:25 --> 11:28] This allowed for a certain Roman laxness when it came to preparations.
[11:29 --> 11:31] They would raise some legions and send them to man the Abro.
[11:32 --> 11:34] Some skirmishes would ensue, but
[11:34 --> 11:36] Hannibal would not be so silly as to cross the river.
[11:37 --> 11:39] He was just testing the limits of Roman tolerance.
[11:40 --> 11:43] But then Hannibal laid siege to Saguntum, and
[11:43 --> 11:46] the Roman hand was forced even further.
[11:46 --> 11:49] Conflicts within the Roman Senate created a mixed response
[11:49 --> 11:52] that all but ensured a full scale war.
[11:52 --> 11:56] Despite the treaty they had signed restricting the legions to the far
[11:56 --> 12:00] side of the Abro, Rome appreciated its alliance with Saguntum and
[12:00 --> 12:03] did not want to see it fall into the hands of the Carthaginians.
[12:04 --> 12:07] So rather than following the treaty to its logical conclusion and
[12:07 --> 12:10] sacrificing Saguntum for the greater peace,
[12:10 --> 12:13] the Romans sent envoys to Carthage demanding an end to the siege.
[12:14 --> 12:17] The Carthaginians replied that they were well within their rights to act in
[12:17 --> 12:20] whatever way they wished in their own territory, and
[12:20 --> 12:21] the Romans ought to butt out.
[12:22 --> 12:26] There were factions in the Carthaginian Senate who did not appreciate the
[12:26 --> 12:30] position Hannibal was putting them in, but a treaty was a treaty, and
[12:30 --> 12:32] the Romans had no legal claim to Saguntum.
[12:32 --> 12:35] So what were they doing making demands and issuing threats?
[12:35 --> 12:40] The Romans were sent away and the Western Mediterranean stood on the brink of war
[12:40 --> 12:41] once again.
[12:41 --> 12:43] All that was left was the official declarations.
[12:46 --> 12:49] Saguntum fell after an eight month siege and Hannibal sacked the city.
[12:50 --> 12:54] The Romans responded by raising a three pronged force to deal with
[12:54 --> 12:56] the now palpable Carthaginian threat.
[12:57 --> 13:01] The main force would be sent to Africa to inflict as much damage there as
[13:01 --> 13:01] possible.
[13:02 --> 13:05] Another would be sent to Spain to deal with Hannibal and
[13:05 --> 13:06] teach the young upstart a lesson.
[13:07 --> 13:11] A third was placed in the Po Valley to deal with any possible invasion
[13:11 --> 13:14] the opportunistic Gauls might attempt.
[13:15 --> 13:18] Of the three, the army in the Po Valley was considered merely a rear
[13:18 --> 13:22] guard defensive force who would possibly but not likely see action.
[13:23 --> 13:26] The war in Roman eyes was clearly going to be fought in Spain,
[13:27 --> 13:29] just as the first Punic war had been fought in Sicily.
[13:30 --> 13:32] Hannibal, however, had other plans.
[13:33 --> 13:37] The army in the Po Valley would soon find themselves not skirmishing with
[13:37 --> 13:42] Gallic tribes, but rather engaging head on a Carthaginian invasion force.
[13:44 --> 13:48] Next week, we will begin what is sure to be at least a month of episodes
[13:48 --> 13:50] dedicated to the second Punic war.
[13:51 --> 13:54] As I said, it is one of the most important and taxing periods in Roman
[13:54 --> 13:58] history and proved to be the closest the Romans would come to destruction
[13:58 --> 14:02] until the crisis of the third century AD 500 years later.
[14:03 --> 14:08] So next time, we will begin the long and arduous path to the Battle of Zama
[14:08 --> 14:13] by following Hannibal's long and arduous path through the Alps to immortality.

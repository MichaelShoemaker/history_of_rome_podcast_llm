[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 33, Marius and Sulla.
[00:13 --> 00:18] After emerging as the hero of the social war, Lucius Cornelius Sulla had been elected
[00:18 --> 00:19] consul in 88 BC.
[00:20 --> 00:25] With the brief civil war put to rest, Roman attention was immediately diverted east,
[00:25 --> 00:30] where Mithridates IV, king of Pontus, was threatening the newly incorporated province
[00:30 --> 00:33] of Asia, located on the far side of the Aegean.
[00:34 --> 00:39] Trouble had been brewing for years, and in 88 BC, Mithridates did not simply cross
[00:39 --> 00:41] the line, he jumped over it.
[00:42 --> 00:47] After several run-ins with the Roman legions garrisoned in the east, Mithridates decided
[00:47 --> 00:52] that the westerners had to go and Anatolia should be returned to her native people.
[00:53 --> 00:58] To this end, he initiated a mass slaughter that was to become known as the Asiatic
[00:58 --> 00:59] Vespers.
[00:59 --> 01:03] Enlisting the help of locals in cities across the Turkish peninsula, anyone who
[01:03 --> 01:07] so much as spoke with a Latin accent was targeted for death.
[01:08 --> 01:13] Over 80,000 Roman citizens and allies were murdered across the east, coinciding
[01:13 --> 01:15] with the king's invasion of Asia.
[01:16 --> 01:21] The Romans were justifiably horrified and immediately raised an invasion force to
[01:21 --> 01:22] avenge the slaughter.
[01:24 --> 01:28] Sulla was the natural choice to lead the invasion, but old Marius had his
[01:28 --> 01:32] mindset on one last fling with glory, and arranged for the senate's choice of
[01:32 --> 01:36] Sulla to lead, to be annulled by the people's assemblies.
[01:37 --> 01:41] This annulment was guaranteed when armed gladiatorial bodyguards and the
[01:41 --> 01:44] employ of Marius and his allies literally threw senators out of the
[01:44 --> 01:47] senate so a quorum could not be reached.
[01:47 --> 01:51] To overturn the decision, to overturn the original decision, the
[01:51 --> 01:52] senate had come to, originally.
[01:54 --> 01:58] The introduction of mob violence into Roman politics precipitated by the
[01:58 --> 02:01] Gracchi was starting to become less and less an exception, and more and
[02:01 --> 02:02] more the rule.
[02:04 --> 02:08] Sulla was forced to flee for his life and made his way to the army and
[02:08 --> 02:09] camped along the Adriatic.
[02:10 --> 02:14] The army was ready for the planned invasion, but before they sailed east,
[02:14 --> 02:16] Sulla would march them west.
[02:17 --> 02:20] He incited the troops, most of whom were loyal to Sulla anyway,
[02:20 --> 02:24] into a frenzy over the anti-democratic thuggery of Marius.
[02:24 --> 02:29] Ready to follow Sulla anywhere, the consul pointed them towards Rome and
[02:29 --> 02:32] announced that with their help he was going to evict Marius from the
[02:32 --> 02:32] city.
[02:33 --> 02:35] His officers were appalled.
[02:35 --> 02:39] It was illegal for the legions to cross the traditional city limits of
[02:39 --> 02:43] Rome, and as much as they disapproved of Marius, they simply could not
[02:43 --> 02:46] abide by Sulla's brazen flouting of the law.
[02:46 --> 02:50] When they reached the city, all but one of Sulla's officers, a close
[02:50 --> 02:53] lieutenant named Lucullus, refused to cross the line.
[02:54 --> 02:57] Sulla respected their decision, but was not dissuaded from his plan
[02:57 --> 03:00] and took the troops right into Rome.
[03:02 --> 03:05] Inside the city, Marian partisans organized gladiators and slaves
[03:05 --> 03:09] into a defense force, but they were no match for trained legionaries,
[03:09 --> 03:13] and in the brief street fighting that ensued, Sulla's army had no
[03:13 --> 03:15] trouble turning the pathetic defenders to heel.
[03:16 --> 03:19] Marius himself barely escaped with his life and fled, along with
[03:19 --> 03:20] his son to Africa.
[03:22 --> 03:25] Sulla restored order to Rome, had Marius declared an enemy of the
[03:25 --> 03:28] state, and put the senate back in control of the city.
[03:28 --> 03:32] All of this drama filled the entirety of Sulla's year as consul,
[03:32 --> 03:35] and it wasn't until 87 BC that he was actually able to lead his
[03:35 --> 03:38] army out of the city to the east, where they should have already
[03:38 --> 03:42] commenced the retaliatory campaign against Mithridates.
[03:44 --> 03:47] But the minute Sulla left town, Marius began to plot his return.
[03:48 --> 03:51] Many in Rome, who had been ambivalent in the political
[03:51 --> 03:54] showdown between Marius and Sulla, had been pushed over to
[03:54 --> 03:57] the Marian camp by Sulla's completely illegal and immoral
[03:57 --> 03:58] seizure of the city.
[03:59 --> 04:03] In 87 BC, the people of Rome did themselves no favors if
[04:03 --> 04:06] they hoped to keep turmoil in the city to a minimum by
[04:06 --> 04:09] electing his co-consuls, Neus Octavius, a staunch
[04:09 --> 04:13] conservative and Sulla partisan, and Lucius Cornelius
[04:13 --> 04:16] Senna, a populare who was fast becoming the leader of
[04:16 --> 04:18] the anti-Sulla forces in Rome.
[04:19 --> 04:22] While not necessarily pro-Marius, Senna nonetheless
[04:22 --> 04:24] saw an alliance with the old general as an advantageous
[04:24 --> 04:27] way to box out Sulla's allies.
[04:29 --> 04:33] Throughout 87 BC, Octavius and Senna clashed repeatedly
[04:33 --> 04:35] until Senna was driven out of town by an angry mob.
[04:37 --> 04:39] Once outside Rome, Senna immediately began gathering
[04:39 --> 04:42] men who were to help him fight his way back to power.
[04:44 --> 04:46] Marius, meanwhile, was raising an army in Africa with
[04:46 --> 04:49] the intention of following the precedent Sulla had just
[04:49 --> 04:52] set by marching on Rome and capturing the city.
[04:53 --> 04:55] When Marius crossed the short span of the
[04:55 --> 04:57] Mediterranean back into Italy at the head of a loyal
[04:57 --> 05:00] army, Senna saw an opportunity to strengthen
[05:00 --> 05:01] his own position.
[05:02 --> 05:05] He formally joined with Marius, and the combined
[05:05 --> 05:06] forces stormed into Rome.
[05:07 --> 05:10] What followed was five straight days of terror and
[05:10 --> 05:11] bloodshed.
[05:12 --> 05:14] Marius simply released his army inside the city with
[05:14 --> 05:18] orders to kill anyone allied with, or suspected of
[05:18 --> 05:20] allying with, or suspected as having the same name
[05:20 --> 05:22] as someone who was allied with Sulla.
[05:23 --> 05:26] Noble families fled or fought depending on their
[05:26 --> 05:26] disposition.
[05:28 --> 05:30] Captured Sulla partisans were killed, and their
[05:30 --> 05:31] heads were displayed in the forum.
[05:32 --> 05:35] Finally, after five days of unchecked violence,
[05:36 --> 05:38] Senna could stand no more and ordered his own troops
[05:38 --> 05:40] to put a stop to Marius' men.
[05:41 --> 05:43] The army from Africa was ordered to stand down,
[05:44 --> 05:46] and those who refused were killed by Senna's troops.
[05:49 --> 05:50] Order finally restored.
[05:50 --> 05:53] Elections for next year's consulships were held.
[05:53 --> 05:56] That Marius and Senna were elected came as no
[05:56 --> 05:56] surprise to anyone.
[05:57 --> 06:00] Everyone who opposed them was either dead or fled.
[06:02 --> 06:04] For Marius, the election to his seventh consulship
[06:04 --> 06:07] fulfilled the promise of his legendary encounter
[06:07 --> 06:09] with the seven eagle chicks so many years
[06:09 --> 06:09] before.
[06:10 --> 06:12] Satisfied that his destiny had been met, the
[06:12 --> 06:15] old general died in 86 BC, just two weeks after
[06:15 --> 06:18] his election, leaving Senna and soul control of
[06:18 --> 06:19] Rome.
[06:21 --> 06:23] While all this drama was unfolding back home,
[06:24 --> 06:26] Sulla was off in the east leading the effort
[06:26 --> 06:27] to repacify Greece.
[06:28 --> 06:31] Mithridates had overrun the province of Asia and
[06:31 --> 06:33] had made the Greek cities along the Aegean coast
[06:33 --> 06:36] his accomplices in the mass murder of Latins
[06:36 --> 06:37] and Anatolia.
[06:38 --> 06:40] Welcomed as a liberator, the king pressed his
[06:40 --> 06:43] luck by going one step further and attempted
[06:43 --> 06:45] to push the Romans out of Greece altogether.
[06:46 --> 06:48] In his effort, he was backed by the Armenian
[06:48 --> 06:51] kingdom, which was reaching the zenith of its
[06:51 --> 06:51] own power.
[06:52 --> 06:54] Combined, the two hoped to retake the eastern
[06:54 --> 06:57] Mediterranean from the alien Westerners.
[06:58 --> 06:59] The ensuing war with Rome would have far
[06:59 --> 07:01] reaching consequences.
[07:01 --> 07:03] Rather than being pushed back to where they
[07:03 --> 07:05] came from, the Romans wound up planting their
[07:05 --> 07:07] standards even further from home.
[07:09 --> 07:12] When Sulla crossed over to a pyrus in 87 BC,
[07:13 --> 07:14] he found that Mithridates was well on his
[07:14 --> 07:16] way to turning the Greeks against Rome.
[07:17 --> 07:20] In Athens, a puppet tyrant had been installed
[07:20 --> 07:22] and was backed by a Pontic army led by
[07:22 --> 07:25] Mithridates' most able general, Archelaus.
[07:26 --> 07:28] This would be as far west as Mithridates would
[07:28 --> 07:30] make it, however, as the mere sight of the
[07:30 --> 07:33] 40,000 Roman soldiers was enough to convince
[07:33 --> 07:36] the remaining Greek cities to remain loyal.
[07:37 --> 07:39] Sulla's first order of business was to bring
[07:39 --> 07:41] Athens back into the Roman fold.
[07:42 --> 07:44] When he arrived, though, the city was
[07:44 --> 07:47] obstinate and shut its gates, so Sulla was
[07:47 --> 07:49] forced to sit back and lay a siege.
[07:50 --> 07:53] While encamped outside the city, refugees from
[07:53 --> 07:56] the Marian reign of terror began to trickle in,
[07:56 --> 07:58] and Sulla first received the news that
[07:58 --> 08:00] Marius had returned to power and that he had
[08:00 --> 08:02] been officially exiled from Rome.
[08:04 --> 08:06] He maintained his focus on the task at hand,
[08:06 --> 08:08] however, and for the rest of the year and
[08:08 --> 08:11] through the beginning of 86 BC, Sulla remained
[08:11 --> 08:12] at the gates of Athens.
[08:13 --> 08:16] Finally, in March of 86, the vigilance of
[08:16 --> 08:18] the Athenian defenders waned and Sulla
[08:18 --> 08:20] stormed the walls in a midnight raid.
[08:21 --> 08:24] Once inside, Sulla was not feeling particularly
[08:24 --> 08:27] generous and did nothing to rein his troops in.
[08:27 --> 08:29] The slaughter was only halted after Greek
[08:29 --> 08:32] friends of Sulla begged him to stop the carnage.
[08:33 --> 08:35] The Pontic army under Archelaus had sailed
[08:35 --> 08:38] north, and Sulla left Athens to lick its
[08:38 --> 08:38] many wounds.
[08:39 --> 08:41] On his way out the door, however, Sulla set
[08:41 --> 08:44] fire to the Athenian port of Piraeus, a
[08:44 --> 08:46] final reminder of what happens to those who
[08:46 --> 08:47] stand against Rome.
[08:50 --> 08:52] Sulla caught up with Archelaus north of Athens
[08:52 --> 08:54] in the Greek province of Boeotia.
[08:54 --> 08:56] The Pontic army by this point numbered
[08:56 --> 08:59] 120,000, three times larger than the Roman
[08:59 --> 09:01] legions chasing them.
[09:01 --> 09:03] Sulla studiously avoided being drawn into a
[09:03 --> 09:05] fight until he found terrain that would
[09:05 --> 09:08] mitigate Archelaus' overwhelming numerical advantage.
[09:09 --> 09:12] Finally, at Chaeronea, Sulla found his spot.
[09:13 --> 09:15] He lured Archelaus into attacking when the
[09:15 --> 09:17] Romans held fortified high ground.
[09:18 --> 09:20] With Sulla personally dashing from wing to
[09:20 --> 09:22] wing to keep up with wave after wave sent
[09:22 --> 09:25] in by Archelaus, the Romans outlasted the
[09:25 --> 09:27] increasingly stretched thin Pontic army.
[09:29 --> 09:31] Seeing a shot, Sulla charged and chased the
[09:31 --> 09:34] opposing army back towards their camp, and
[09:34 --> 09:36] circling them before they reached home base.
[09:37 --> 09:40] The final casualty figure showed that while
[09:40 --> 09:42] the Pontic army had been slaughtered, the
[09:42 --> 09:43] Romans emerged from the battle practically
[09:45 --> 09:45] unscathed.
[09:46 --> 09:48] With this smashing victory in Greece, Sulla
[09:48 --> 09:50] remained as popular as ever with the people
[09:50 --> 09:52] of Rome, despite the continuing hostility from
[09:52 --> 09:55] the elites left in the city, and the fact
[09:55 --> 09:56] that he technically was in exile.
[09:58 --> 10:01] Sulla was re-elected consul in 85 BC, and
[10:01 --> 10:03] decided that Sulla needed to be formally
[10:03 --> 10:05] relieved of duty, not because there was
[10:05 --> 10:07] any doubt he would triumph over Mithridates,
[10:07 --> 10:09] but because there was no doubt he would
[10:09 --> 10:12] eventually triumph over Mithridates, and
[10:12 --> 10:14] that victory would leave Sulla unquestionably
[10:14 --> 10:16] the most powerful man in Rome.
[10:17 --> 10:20] So Sulla raised an army and placed men with
[10:20 --> 10:22] strong anti-Sulla passions in charge.
[10:23 --> 10:25] They were to find Sulla, relieve him of
[10:25 --> 10:27] his command, and combine the two armies.
[10:28 --> 10:30] However, when the army led by Lucius
[10:30 --> 10:33] Valerius Flaccus and Gaius Flavius Fimbria
[10:33 --> 10:35] arrived in camp beside Sulla's army,
[10:35 --> 10:36] things went backward.
[10:37 --> 10:39] Sulla encouraged the new arrivals to defect
[10:39 --> 10:41] over to his side, and pretty soon the new
[10:41 --> 10:43] army was hemorrhaging troops.
[10:44 --> 10:46] Flaccus, unable to make Sulla stand down,
[10:46 --> 10:47] led his army north.
[10:48 --> 10:49] Officially to track down the army,
[10:49 --> 10:52] Mithridates himself was leading towards Greece,
[10:52 --> 10:55] but unofficially to simply distance himself
[10:55 --> 10:57] from the seductive charisma of Sulla.
[10:59 --> 11:01] The dissension in the ranks spread, however,
[11:01 --> 11:03] and the remaining troops soured on Flaccus.
[11:04 --> 11:06] Eventually, his second-in-command Fimbria
[11:06 --> 11:07] led a mutiny.
[11:08 --> 11:10] Flaccus was murdered and Fimbria took over,
[11:10 --> 11:12] but being a staunch Marian partisan,
[11:13 --> 11:15] the new leader had no intention of joining with Sulla.
[11:16 --> 11:18] He just wanted to take Mithridates himself
[11:18 --> 11:20] and steal Sulla's thunder.
[11:22 --> 11:24] Sulla himself remained behind in Boeotia,
[11:25 --> 11:27] readying himself for the rematch with Archelaus,
[11:27 --> 11:29] who was being reinforced from the east
[11:29 --> 11:31] by the Armenians, and soon was back
[11:31 --> 11:33] at the head of an army, again numbering
[11:33 --> 11:34] more than 100,000.
[11:35 --> 11:37] The two sides met at Orchomenos,
[11:37 --> 11:40] but the outcome was no different this time around.
[11:41 --> 11:43] The superior tactical ability of Sulla,
[11:43 --> 11:45] which was executed by the far more disciplined
[11:45 --> 11:48] Roman soldiers, was too much for the Pontic army.
[11:49 --> 11:52] Once again, Archelaus was forced to make a run for it,
[11:52 --> 11:54] as Sulla annihilated the army he left behind.
[11:57 --> 11:59] After crossing the Hellespon into Asia,
[11:59 --> 12:02] Fimbria found Mithridates and fought a limited battle
[12:02 --> 12:05] that saw Rome get the better of the Pontic king.
[12:06 --> 12:07] But without support from the Roman navy
[12:07 --> 12:10] patrolling the Aegean, Mithridates was able
[12:10 --> 12:11] to slip away from Fimbria.
[12:12 --> 12:16] The navy, led by Lachois, Sulla's most loyal officer,
[12:16 --> 12:18] was not about to come to the aid of a political enemy.
[12:20 --> 12:22] Mithridates, however, could see the handwriting
[12:22 --> 12:24] on the wall, and in late 85 BC,
[12:24 --> 12:26] he offered to come to terms with the Romans.
[12:27 --> 12:29] The Pontic king met with Sulla,
[12:29 --> 12:31] much to Fimbria's dismay,
[12:31 --> 12:33] and peace terms were hashed out.
[12:34 --> 12:36] Mithridates was to remain in control of Pontus,
[12:37 --> 12:38] but had to otherwise withdraw his forces
[12:38 --> 12:40] from every other region he occupied.
[12:42 --> 12:44] Rome would move in and occupy these territories,
[12:44 --> 12:47] extending Roman dominion even further into the east.
[12:48 --> 12:49] The territories that had rebelled
[12:49 --> 12:51] and the newly acquired regions
[12:51 --> 12:54] were forced to pay a steep price for challenging Rome.
[12:55 --> 12:57] Not only was the annual tax burden increased,
[12:58 --> 12:59] but Sulla demanded five years' worth
[12:59 --> 13:01] of back taxes at the same rate.
[13:02 --> 13:05] The financial punishment left most of Anatolia deep in debt
[13:05 --> 13:07] and unable to direct their wealth
[13:07 --> 13:09] towards any other end than paying back Rome.
[13:10 --> 13:13] This, in addition to filling Rome's coffers,
[13:13 --> 13:15] kept them from making further mischief.
[13:18 --> 13:20] With the war against Mithridates settled,
[13:20 --> 13:22] Sulla returned to his war
[13:22 --> 13:24] against his domestic political opponents.
[13:24 --> 13:27] Fimbria, who had taken command of the province of Asia,
[13:27 --> 13:29] was of immediate concern.
[13:29 --> 13:31] The mutinous general talked a good game,
[13:32 --> 13:34] but the minute Sulla crossed the Hellespont,
[13:34 --> 13:35] Fimbria committed suicide,
[13:36 --> 13:37] knowing he was no match for Sulla
[13:37 --> 13:39] and would likely be executed
[13:39 --> 13:40] one way or the other for his actions.
[13:41 --> 13:43] With the east fully pacified,
[13:43 --> 13:46] Sulla began to strategize about a return to Rome.
[13:47 --> 13:49] Senna, who had effectively run the city
[13:49 --> 13:51] for the past few years unopposed,
[13:51 --> 13:53] was well aware that if Sulla came back,
[13:53 --> 13:55] the party would come to an abrupt end.
[13:56 --> 13:59] Taking advantage of some minor commotion in Illyria,
[13:59 --> 14:01] Senna raised an army to quell the unrest.
[14:02 --> 14:05] The fact that Illyria lay directly between Sulla and Rome
[14:05 --> 14:07] had nothing to do with Senna's desire
[14:07 --> 14:09] to march an army there, of course.
[14:10 --> 14:12] In his haste, bordering on panic,
[14:12 --> 14:14] to get his army in place,
[14:14 --> 14:16] Senna, however, pushed his troops too hard,
[14:17 --> 14:18] force-marching them through snowdrifts
[14:18 --> 14:21] to reach Illyria in time to block Sulla's path.
[14:23 --> 14:25] In one of history's little twists of fate,
[14:26 --> 14:27] Senna's soldiers mutinied
[14:27 --> 14:29] and stoned the four-time consul to death.
[14:31 --> 14:33] The path to Rome now lay open,
[14:33 --> 14:34] and hearing the news,
[14:34 --> 14:37] Sulla immediately ordered his troops to head home.
[14:37 --> 14:41] Sulla, it seemed, was marching on Rome, again.
[14:43 --> 14:45] There will be no episode next week,
[14:45 --> 14:48] as I will be spending the weekend moving across town,
[14:48 --> 14:50] but in two weeks,
[14:50 --> 14:52] we'll return for Sulla's second march on Rome,
[14:53 --> 14:55] the crowning of Rome's first dictator for life,
[14:56 --> 14:57] and, inexplicably,
[14:57 --> 15:00] the retirement of Rome's first dictator for life.
[15:04 --> 15:04] ["The First Dictator for Life"]
[15:22 --> 15:22] ["The First Dictator for Life"]

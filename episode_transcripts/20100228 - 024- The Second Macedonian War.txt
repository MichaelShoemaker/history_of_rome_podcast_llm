[00:04 --> 00:12] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, Episode 24, The Second Macedonian War.
[00:13 --> 00:19] Last time, we ended with the Roman victory over Carthage in 202 BC, leaving Rome as
[00:19 --> 00:22] the undisputed master of the Western Mediterranean.
[00:23 --> 00:28] After nearly 20 years locked in a massively destructive conflict, one might assume
[00:28 --> 00:33] that the Romans would take some time off. After all, the demise of Carthage left no
[00:33 --> 00:37] real challenge to the Roman hegemony in the West, and there was an abundance of
[00:37 --> 00:42] new trading opportunities, lands to settle, farms to rebuild, and families
[00:42 --> 00:46] to grow. Why not enjoy the fruits of their newfound dominance and retire
[00:46 --> 00:51] peacefully to country estates to grow olives and sip wine? Beat the
[00:51 --> 00:55] swords into plowshares, as it were, and leave the battlefield unstained
[00:55 --> 01:01] with Roman blood. At least for a little while. A generation? Maybe? Not likely.
[01:02 --> 01:06] Immediately after winning the West, the Romans wasted no time leveraging their
[01:06 --> 01:10] newfound big boy status and embroiling themselves in the cutthroat
[01:10 --> 01:15] world of Greek power politics. The rationale behind an intervention in the
[01:15 --> 01:19] East is obscure, and at first blush doesn't seem to make a whole lot of
[01:19 --> 01:24] sense. The Romans had no long-standing ties in Greece and no
[01:24 --> 01:28] investment in the region. As I've mentioned a few times, the Adriatic
[01:28 --> 01:32] divided the Mediterranean into two worlds. The Romans had finally won
[01:32 --> 01:36] control of their half. It seemed strange that they would risk what they had
[01:36 --> 01:40] just achieved by suddenly launching themselves into the middle of a game
[01:40 --> 01:44] they'd never before competed in or stood any real chance of winning
[01:44 --> 01:49] without immense effort. But history is what it is, and rather than taking a
[01:49 --> 01:52] breath, the Romans moved East as a first step towards capturing the whole
[01:52 --> 01:57] of the Mediterranean, a feat never before accomplished, and since the fall
[01:57 --> 02:03] of Rome, a feat never again repeated. Roman intervention in Greece was
[02:03 --> 02:07] precipitated by a fateful pact between two men who would command the
[02:07 --> 02:11] army's opposite the legions in the coming decades, Philip V of Macedon
[02:11 --> 02:16] and Antiochus the Great of the Seleucid Empire. The Eastern
[02:16 --> 02:20] Mediterranean was still very much living in a post-Alexandrian world,
[02:20 --> 02:24] and the dominant kingdom's jockeying for position had grown from the
[02:24 --> 02:29] satrapies established by Alexander's generals. Egypt was ruled by the
[02:29 --> 02:32] descendants of Ptolemy, Syria and Persia were ruled by the descendants
[02:32 --> 02:37] of Seleucis, and Macedon, the birthplace of the great general, was
[02:37 --> 02:41] re-rising to a position of power under Philip V after years caught up
[02:41 --> 02:46] in dynastic struggles. In 204 BC, as Scipio was launching his
[02:46 --> 02:51] expedition against Carthage, Ptolemy IV of Egypt died, leaving his
[02:51 --> 02:56] six-year-old son as heir. Seizing quickly on the leadership vacuum
[02:56 --> 03:00] in Egypt, Philip and Antiochus agreed to jointly exploit the
[03:00 --> 03:04] situation and move against Egyptian holdings in Asia Minor and
[03:04 --> 03:08] Syria. The idea was simple, attack quickly on two fronts and
[03:08 --> 03:13] conquer what territory they could. Around the same time Scipio
[03:13 --> 03:17] was dictating terms to the Carthaginians, Antiochus moved
[03:17 --> 03:20] south towards the Red Sea and Philip moved east, attacking
[03:20 --> 03:24] Thrace, the territory west of the narrow sea lane that links
[03:24 --> 03:28] the Aegean and Black Seas, called the Hellespont in ancient
[03:28 --> 03:33] times and today called the Dardanelles. This joint action
[03:33 --> 03:36] immediately upset the apple cart of Greek power sharing and
[03:36 --> 03:39] sent the kingdom of Pergamum, which lay on the east side
[03:39 --> 03:44] of the Hellespont, into a tizzy. Aetolus I, king of
[03:44 --> 03:47] Pergamum, smelled absolutely nothing good coming from an
[03:47 --> 03:51] alliance between Philip and Antiochus. Aetolus' kingdom in
[03:51 --> 03:54] Asia Minor bordered both rival powers. It was not hard
[03:54 --> 03:57] to divine where the two allied kings would look next
[03:57 --> 04:00] when they were done stripping young Ptolemy of his
[04:00 --> 04:04] inheritance. But luckily, Aetolus had built up invaluable
[04:04 --> 04:07] goodwill from the ascendant Romans who were just coming
[04:07 --> 04:11] off their big win over Carthage. Aetolus had been
[04:11 --> 04:13] amongst those allied with Rome against Macedon during the
[04:13 --> 04:18] First Macedonian War. Along with the Aetolians, Aetolus
[04:18 --> 04:21] had helped keep Philip's attention firmly in Greece and
[04:21 --> 04:24] the Romans understood the role this played in their
[04:24 --> 04:27] ultimate victory over Carthage, or at least Aetolus
[04:27 --> 04:30] hoped they understood because it was time for them to
[04:30 --> 04:34] repay the favor. Pergamum, allied with the island kingdom
[04:34 --> 04:37] of Rhodes, was for the time being holding its own against
[04:37 --> 04:41] Macedonian encroachment. But in 201 BC, official envoys
[04:41 --> 04:46] were sent to Rome to plead for aid. The Roman Senate,
[04:46 --> 04:49] while not forgetting their friendship with Aetolus, still
[04:49 --> 04:51] sent the Greek envoys away without the promise of aid.
[04:52 --> 04:55] They had just come off a costly war with Carthage. Now
[04:55 --> 04:58] was not the time to go plunging headlong into Greece.
[04:59 --> 05:02] But elements within the Senate argued for immediate action.
[05:02 --> 05:05] Philip had been moving for years against Rome, and if his
[05:05 --> 05:08] ambition was allowed to proceed unchecked, when his
[05:08 --> 05:11] attention inevitably turned back to the West, he would
[05:11 --> 05:15] come knocking that much richer and that much stronger. If
[05:15 --> 05:18] Rome was worried about the cost of a war today, think
[05:18 --> 05:21] of what the cost would be tomorrow. It was agreed then
[05:21 --> 05:24] that envoys should be sent to Greece to take the
[05:24 --> 05:27] temperature of the locals and reassess whether the Romans
[05:27 --> 05:29] needed to take a stand now or whether they could afford
[05:29 --> 05:30] to wait.
[05:32 --> 05:35] On the road to Athens, the Roman envoys were fast
[05:35 --> 05:38] concluding that a war with Macedon was the last thing
[05:38 --> 05:42] anyone wanted. But coinciding with their arrival in
[05:42 --> 05:45] Athens, the Athenians declared war against Macedon,
[05:45 --> 05:49] and Philip ordered a force to pacify Attica. Meeting
[05:49 --> 05:52] with Aetolus and ambassadors from Rhodes and Athens,
[05:52 --> 05:55] the Romans decided to issue an ultimatum to Macedon,
[05:56 --> 05:58] clear out of Greece and come to terms with Pergamum
[05:58 --> 06:03] roads or deal with the consequences. The Macedonian
[06:03 --> 06:05] force in Attica retreated and the message was taken to
[06:05 --> 06:10] Philip. The Macedonian king rejected the ultimatum,
[06:10 --> 06:13] ordering his forces to attack Athens again, and
[06:13 --> 06:15] moved himself back east to the Hellespont, where he
[06:15 --> 06:18] launched a campaign to wrest control of the Eastern
[06:18 --> 06:23] Bank from Pergamum. In 200 BC, Roman envoys found
[06:23 --> 06:25] Philip still directing his troops along Pergamum's
[06:25 --> 06:29] border and issued him a second ultimatum. Withdraw
[06:29 --> 06:32] from all Greek cities and confine himself back to
[06:32 --> 06:34] traditional Macedonian territory, or he would be
[06:34 --> 06:38] looking at war with Rome. Philip protested that
[06:38 --> 06:40] nothing he had done was in violation of the
[06:40 --> 06:41] treaty he had signed with the Romans at the end
[06:41 --> 06:44] of the First Macedonian War, and they were
[06:44 --> 06:46] reaching well beyond their authority if they
[06:46 --> 06:48] thought they could dictate policy so far from
[06:48 --> 06:51] Italy. The second ultimatum, however, was a
[06:51 --> 06:55] mere formality. At the same time, Roman envoys
[06:55 --> 06:57] were explaining what they would do if Philip
[06:57 --> 06:59] rejected peace. They were already launching an
[06:59 --> 07:02] army, knowing Philip would never accept Roman
[07:02 --> 07:05] terms. Confident after securing allies in
[07:05 --> 07:08] Greece, the Senate had changed its tune and
[07:08 --> 07:11] decided that war now was preferable to war
[07:11 --> 07:14] later. Philip had to be stopped before he
[07:14 --> 07:16] acquired more strength.
[07:18 --> 07:20] Legions under the command of Publius Galba were
[07:20 --> 07:25] sent across the Adriatic into Illyria, the
[07:25 --> 07:27] What followed was a year of indeterminate
[07:27 --> 07:30] skirmishing, with neither side doing much to
[07:30 --> 07:32] risk their armies. Philip was still trying to
[07:32 --> 07:34] get a handle on whether the Romans were truly
[07:34 --> 07:37] committed to a war, and Galba had no real
[07:37 --> 07:40] interest in a fall-on attack. The next year
[07:40 --> 07:43] saw changing consuls, but the continuation of
[07:43 --> 07:46] the same policy. Open war was not being
[07:46 --> 07:48] courted, and the entire affair seemed
[07:48 --> 07:50] destined for counter maneuvers until the two
[07:50 --> 07:52] sides made concessions to one another and
[07:52 --> 07:56] reached an amenable peace. However, in the
[07:56 --> 08:01] third year, 198 BC, things would change. Titus
[08:01 --> 08:03] Flaminius was elected consul and given
[08:03 --> 08:06] command of Greek operations. He fully
[08:06 --> 08:08] embraced the notion that Philip had to be
[08:08 --> 08:11] brought low, or Macedon would forever
[08:11 --> 08:14] pose a threat to Rome. Beyond these
[08:14 --> 08:16] immediate strategic interests, Flaminius
[08:16 --> 08:18] himself was a great lover of Greek
[08:18 --> 08:21] culture, and saw Roman exposure to, and
[08:21 --> 08:23] power over Greece to be inherently
[08:23 --> 08:26] beneficial and well worth fighting for.
[08:27 --> 08:28] Flaminius took a bold stand against
[08:28 --> 08:30] Philip, and, hoping to win over the
[08:30 --> 08:33] mostly neutral Greek cities, recast Roman
[08:33 --> 08:35] policy as a defense of Greek liberty.
[08:36 --> 08:38] In this conception, Rome was not another
[08:38 --> 08:41] power looking for new territory, but a
[08:41 --> 08:44] shield against Macedonian tyranny. This
[08:44 --> 08:46] recasting of the struggle won over the
[08:46 --> 08:51] elites of the Greek city-states, and
[08:51 --> 08:54] his diplomatic coup well underway,
[08:54 --> 08:56] Flaminius matched word with action, and
[08:56 --> 08:58] went looking for Philip's army, intent
[08:58 --> 09:00] on breaking the Macedonians.
[09:01 --> 09:03] Later in the year, a short battle was
[09:03 --> 09:04] fought between the two armies, with
[09:04 --> 09:06] the upshot being the withdrawal of
[09:06 --> 09:08] Philip, and the stage being set for a
[09:08 --> 09:11] larger, decisive confrontation the next
[09:11 --> 09:11] year.
[09:13 --> 09:15] The Greeks were flocking to Rome and
[09:15 --> 09:18] away from Macedon, sensing that the
[09:18 --> 09:20] ballgame had changed, and the Romans
[09:20 --> 09:21] were now serious about the fight,
[09:22 --> 09:24] Philip made peace overtures to Flaminius.
[09:25 --> 09:27] The Roman consul opened negotiations,
[09:27 --> 09:29] but was himself unsure of how he
[09:29 --> 09:30] wanted to proceed.
[09:31 --> 09:33] The consular elections were coming up,
[09:33 --> 09:35] and Flaminius, like so many of his
[09:35 --> 09:37] predecessors, was worried about some
[09:37 --> 09:39] newbie sweeping in and stealing all
[09:39 --> 09:40] his glory.
[09:41 --> 09:42] He intentionally dragged out the talks,
[09:43 --> 09:45] waiting to hear from his allies in
[09:45 --> 09:46] the senate, whether his command in
[09:46 --> 09:48] Greece would be renewed, or given to
[09:48 --> 09:49] anyone else.
[09:50 --> 09:52] If the senate ordered the new consul
[09:52 --> 09:53] for the year to take over,
[09:54 --> 09:55] Flaminius planned to cut a quick
[09:55 --> 09:57] peace with Philip, and return a hero.
[09:58 --> 10:00] If he was kept on his proconsul,
[10:00 --> 10:02] however, he would end talks, and plan
[10:02 --> 10:04] for a new campaign the next year.
[10:05 --> 10:07] He made all kinds of excuses to
[10:07 --> 10:08] explain the slow pace of
[10:08 --> 10:11] negotiations, and even advised Philip
[10:11 --> 10:12] to send envoys directly to Rome to
[10:12 --> 10:13] speed things along.
[10:14 --> 10:17] But it was all to by time, and soon
[10:17 --> 10:19] Flaminius got word that the senate had
[10:19 --> 10:21] decided to allow him to continue to
[10:21 --> 10:22] lead the war against Philip.
[10:23 --> 10:25] With that, peace talks were cut off,
[10:26 --> 10:27] and Flaminius readied his army for
[10:27 --> 10:28] more fighting.
[10:29 --> 10:32] Philip, nonplussed at the whole affair,
[10:32 --> 10:34] acquired 25,000 mercenaries
[10:34 --> 10:36] in an attempt to match the growing
[10:36 --> 10:37] Roman allied force,
[10:37 --> 10:39] which now included the full-throated
[10:39 --> 10:40] support of the Aetolian League,
[10:41 --> 10:42] with a collection of cities that had
[10:42 --> 10:44] proved so troublesome to Philip
[10:44 --> 10:45] during the First Macedonian War.
[10:46 --> 10:49] Numbering somewhere north of 30,000,
[10:49 --> 10:51] the Romans met Philip and his army at
[10:51 --> 10:54] Cynoscephaly in 197 BC.
[10:55 --> 10:56] What followed was not just the
[10:56 --> 10:58] decisive battle of the war,
[10:58 --> 10:59] but one of the most important
[10:59 --> 11:01] turning points in the history of the
[11:01 --> 11:02] western world.
[11:03 --> 11:05] The waxing of Rome and the waning of
[11:05 --> 11:07] Greece was confirmed that day,
[11:07 --> 11:09] as the maniple system of the Roman
[11:09 --> 11:11] legions decimated the Macedonian
[11:11 --> 11:11] phalanx.
[11:12 --> 11:14] It was one thing for Rome to defeat
[11:14 --> 11:17] other Italians and Gauls or Spaniards
[11:17 --> 11:17] and North Africans,
[11:18 --> 11:20] but Greece had been the home of the
[11:20 --> 11:22] premier military powers of the ancient
[11:22 --> 11:22] world.
[11:23 --> 11:26] Alexander the Great, Sparta, the Navy of
[11:26 --> 11:26] Athens,
[11:27 --> 11:29] all were ahead of their time and
[11:29 --> 11:30] irresistible forces on the
[11:30 --> 11:31] battlefield.
[11:31 --> 11:33] It was unthinkable for the Greeks to
[11:33 --> 11:34] lose in battle to foreigners,
[11:35 --> 11:37] and yet at the end of the day,
[11:37 --> 11:38] Rome stood triumphant
[11:38 --> 11:40] and Greek liberty, despite
[11:40 --> 11:42] Flaminius's clever propaganda,
[11:42 --> 11:45] was snuffed out once and for all.
[11:46 --> 11:48] As I mentioned in episode 14, the
[11:48 --> 11:50] Romans had taken the phalanx and
[11:50 --> 11:52] modified it to be more maneuverable,
[11:52 --> 11:54] more versatile, and allow for
[11:54 --> 11:55] independent lines of attack.
[11:56 --> 11:58] All of these advantages would come into
[11:58 --> 11:59] play at Cynicephali.
[12:01 --> 12:03] The battle itself came about by
[12:03 --> 12:05] accident. In 197,
[12:05 --> 12:07] Flaminius marched north from Thebes
[12:07 --> 12:09] into Macedonian territory looking for
[12:09 --> 12:09] Philip.
[12:10 --> 12:12] The two armies encountered each other
[12:12 --> 12:14] and fought a brief skirmish,
[12:14 --> 12:16] but each pulled out to reprovision and
[12:16 --> 12:18] find better ground to fight on.
[12:19 --> 12:21] By sheer luck, both armies headed in
[12:21 --> 12:22] the same direction
[12:22 --> 12:24] looking for provisions. However, the
[12:24 --> 12:25] Cynicephali hills
[12:25 --> 12:28] divided the two and they were unaware
[12:28 --> 12:28] of each other.
[12:30 --> 12:32] The next morning, some of Philip's
[12:32 --> 12:33] troops became disoriented in an early
[12:33 --> 12:35] fog and marched over the hills.
[12:36 --> 12:37] The Romans noticed this sudden
[12:37 --> 12:39] appearance of the enemy,
[12:39 --> 12:41] and Flaminius ordered some of his
[12:41 --> 12:43] cavalry, Numidians now fighting on the
[12:43 --> 12:44] side of Rome,
[12:44 --> 12:47] to pursue the Macedonians. The cavalry
[12:47 --> 12:49] stumbled across Philip's main force,
[12:49 --> 12:51] and Flaminius ordered 2,000 troops to
[12:51 --> 12:53] press an attack on Philip's camp,
[12:53 --> 12:55] forcing the Macedonians to pull up
[12:55 --> 12:56] into the hills en masse.
[12:57 --> 12:58] After driving off the Roman
[12:58 --> 13:00] expeditionary force,
[13:00 --> 13:02] Philip ordered his troops to come
[13:02 --> 13:03] down a ways from the hills
[13:03 --> 13:05] and form in the rigid line of a
[13:05 --> 13:06] phalanx for battle.
[13:08 --> 13:10] Flaminius had by this time lined up
[13:10 --> 13:10] his own troops
[13:10 --> 13:12] and led the Roman left personally
[13:12 --> 13:14] against the Macedonian right,
[13:14 --> 13:17] which was led by Philip. The Macedonian
[13:17 --> 13:17] right,
[13:18 --> 13:19] with the high ground in their favor,
[13:19 --> 13:21] was proving more than a match for
[13:21 --> 13:21] Flaminius,
[13:22 --> 13:24] but the Macedonian left was having a
[13:24 --> 13:25] difficult time lining up on the
[13:25 --> 13:26] broken ground,
[13:26 --> 13:28] and the Roman right was able to
[13:28 --> 13:29] smash through the line
[13:29 --> 13:31] before it was formed. At this point,
[13:32 --> 13:33] an unnamed Roman officer,
[13:34 --> 13:36] on his own initiative, ordered a group
[13:36 --> 13:37] of manopoles under his command
[13:37 --> 13:39] to wheel around and attack the rear of
[13:39 --> 13:40] Philip's army.
[13:41 --> 13:42] Trapped in their phalanx, the
[13:42 --> 13:44] Macedonians were unable to turn to
[13:44 --> 13:45] face this new threat,
[13:46 --> 13:47] and as soon as the new Roman force
[13:47 --> 13:49] hit, the battle turned from a fair
[13:49 --> 13:50] fight
[13:50 --> 13:53] into a slaughter. Philip was able to
[13:53 --> 13:54] slip away,
[13:54 --> 13:57] but his army was decimated. The
[13:57 --> 13:58] Roman manopoles,
[13:58 --> 14:00] which formed quicker on rough terrain
[14:00 --> 14:02] and were capable of independent action,
[14:03 --> 14:04] proved superior to the Greek
[14:04 --> 14:05] phalanx,
[14:05 --> 14:07] which was only effective on the right
[14:07 --> 14:08] terrain, and even then,
[14:08 --> 14:10] only if given enough time to form
[14:10 --> 14:11] properly.
[14:12 --> 14:14] And, of course, once a phalanx was
[14:14 --> 14:15] flanked,
[14:15 --> 14:18] that's all she wrote. The structural
[14:18 --> 14:19] advantage of the Roman
[14:19 --> 14:20] manopole system was the decisive
[14:20 --> 14:21] element of the battle,
[14:22 --> 14:23] which in time would come to
[14:23 --> 14:24] symbolize more than just a tactical
[14:24 --> 14:25] victory,
[14:26 --> 14:27] but mark a critical turning point in
[14:27 --> 14:28] history.
[14:31 --> 14:32] In a clever move born out of
[14:32 --> 14:33] necessity,
[14:33 --> 14:35] Flaminius announced that the Roman
[14:35 --> 14:36] legions would not garrison Greece.
[14:37 --> 14:39] Greece was free, he declared, much to
[14:39 --> 14:41] the relieved ears of the Greeks.
[14:42 --> 14:44] The truth was that the Romans had not
[14:44 --> 14:45] the men
[14:45 --> 14:47] nor the money to occupy Greece, but
[14:47 --> 14:49] of course the Romans sold the
[14:49 --> 14:50] absence of an occupying army
[14:50 --> 14:53] in the loftiest moral terms. The
[14:53 --> 14:54] Greeks,
[14:54 --> 14:55] proud of their historical liberty,
[14:56 --> 14:57] were more than happy to go along
[14:57 --> 14:58] with the Roman
[14:58 --> 15:00] story and thanked Flaminius for
[15:00 --> 15:00] setting them free.
[15:01 --> 15:03] It would prove to be a peculiar form
[15:03 --> 15:04] of freedom,
[15:04 --> 15:06] as the Romans had no intention of just
[15:06 --> 15:08] allowing the Greeks to go off and do
[15:08 --> 15:09] whatever they want.
[15:10 --> 15:12] To the Romans, a freed slave still had
[15:12 --> 15:14] obligations to his former master.
[15:15 --> 15:16] The Greeks, who thought they really
[15:16 --> 15:18] were free, began to chafe under the
[15:18 --> 15:20] demands from Rome for tribute.
[15:21 --> 15:23] The tension between the allegedly free
[15:23 --> 15:24] Greeks and the Romans would boil
[15:24 --> 15:25] over soon enough,
[15:26 --> 15:27] and after 50 years of sporadic
[15:27 --> 15:29] fighting, all pretenses would be
[15:29 --> 15:29] lifted
[15:29 --> 15:32] and Greece would be incorporated as a
[15:32 --> 15:33] collection of provinces.
[15:36 --> 15:38] The honeymoon period did not last long,
[15:38 --> 15:41] and next week the bitter Aetolian
[15:41 --> 15:43] League, denied territorial concessions
[15:43 --> 15:45] during the peace negotiations with
[15:45 --> 15:45] Philip,
[15:45 --> 15:47] would call upon the last best
[15:47 --> 15:49] offender of Hellenistic power,
[15:49 --> 15:51] Antiochus the Great, to enter Greece
[15:51 --> 15:52] and free them
[15:52 --> 15:54] from their not yet official bondage.
[15:55 --> 15:57] The war with Antiochus would draw the
[15:57 --> 15:58] Romans further east,
[15:58 --> 16:00] where they would run smack into an
[16:00 --> 16:01] enemy they thought they had driven off
[16:01 --> 16:02] forever,
[16:03 --> 16:04] Hannibal the Great Terrible.

[00:03 --> 00:06] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:12] To answer one of the most basic questions about Rome, why was it able to control so
[00:12 --> 00:17] much territory for so long, one need look no further than the Roman legion.
[00:17 --> 00:22] There were myriad secondary reasons, competent hands-off administration, sound economic
[00:22 --> 00:27] policies, and superior engineering skills, but at the beginning and end of the day,
[00:27 --> 00:30] it was the legion that secured the longevity of Rome.
[00:31 --> 00:33] No fighting force matched it in the ancient world.
[00:34 --> 00:38] But its dominance was not the result of finding a perfect method of organizing
[00:38 --> 00:42] and leading men and then sticking to that static model forever.
[00:42 --> 00:47] Rather, the Romans constantly tinkered, rearranged, and proved the legions,
[00:47 --> 00:48] depending on circumstances.
[00:49 --> 00:52] One of the great virtues of Rome, and one the Romans themselves took immense
[00:52 --> 00:57] pride in, was their ability to learn from their own mistakes and adopt the
[00:57 --> 00:58] superior methods of their enemies.
[01:00 --> 01:04] When I was in college, I took a course in ancient political theory where we
[01:04 --> 01:07] studied Plato and Aristotle, the Sophists, and other Greek thinkers.
[01:08 --> 01:12] But when we got to the Romans, apart from some cursory reading of Cicero
[01:12 --> 01:16] and Marcus Aurelius, my professor spent the class periods teaching us legion
[01:16 --> 01:19] infantry tactics and how the Roman roads and camps were built.
[01:20 --> 01:24] That was Roman political theory, not discourses on the meaning of justice
[01:24 --> 01:28] or comparative essays on state organization, but rather how best to build
[01:28 --> 01:32] a wall and how to maintain lines of communication in the thick of battle.
[01:33 --> 01:36] The Romans did not spend a lot of time with their head in the clouds,
[01:37 --> 01:39] but they did spend a lot of time with their feet in the mud.
[01:40 --> 01:45] The power, dominance, and stability, and legacy of Rome is all wrapped up
[01:45 --> 01:46] in its army.
[01:46 --> 01:49] Understanding the legions is critical to understanding the Romans,
[01:50 --> 01:53] and shifts in how the legions operated mirrored shifts in the
[01:53 --> 01:55] socio-political world that surrounded them.
[01:57 --> 02:00] I originally intended this section to be one episode, but as I progressed,
[02:00 --> 02:02] it kept growing and growing.
[02:02 --> 02:05] And so, rather than inundating you with too much information,
[02:05 --> 02:07] I have decided to divide it into two parts.
[02:08 --> 02:12] Today, I will give a brief overview how the legions changed over the years
[02:12 --> 02:15] and then go into detail about the Greek phalanx in particular,
[02:16 --> 02:19] what it was, why it was so strong, and what its flaws were.
[02:20 --> 02:23] The Romans used the phalanx until the Samnite Wars,
[02:23 --> 02:26] when they morphed into a new system I will detail next week.
[02:27 --> 02:29] For those of you with a background in ancient history,
[02:29 --> 02:32] I'm sure you've heard more than enough about the phalanx,
[02:32 --> 02:34] but I want to make sure everyone is on the same page,
[02:34 --> 02:38] and I think understanding infantry tactics is critical to understanding
[02:38 --> 02:40] classical Mediterranean history as a whole.
[02:42 --> 02:44] In general, and this is very general,
[02:45 --> 02:48] the army of the Roman Republic had four distinct phases.
[02:48 --> 02:52] The first phase was ushered in by Romulus when he founded the army.
[02:53 --> 02:55] It was originally formed like any other barbarian horde,
[02:56 --> 02:59] with a strong leader leading a mass of men who charged at the enemy
[02:59 --> 03:04] and battled hand to hand, one on one, until one side overpowered the other.
[03:05 --> 03:08] The second phase began roughly with the class reforms of Servius
[03:08 --> 03:10] in the mid-500s BC.
[03:10 --> 03:14] At this point, the Romans began to utilize the Greek phalanx,
[03:14 --> 03:17] relying on disciplined, group-oriented attacks
[03:17 --> 03:19] rather than the free-for-all of Romulus' day.
[03:20 --> 03:22] This lasted until the mid-300s BC,
[03:23 --> 03:26] when the Samnite Wars exposed dangerous flaws in the phalanx
[03:26 --> 03:29] and forced the Romans to reorganize their entire army
[03:29 --> 03:32] and start a third phase based around the Manapal,
[03:32 --> 03:34] which I will discuss at length next week.
[03:35 --> 03:37] Later, around 100 BC,
[03:37 --> 03:41] Marius ushered in the fourth and final phase of the Republican army,
[03:41 --> 03:45] instituting a series of reforms affecting not just how the army fought tactically,
[03:45 --> 03:48] but also how the soldiers were recruited,
[03:48 --> 03:53] removing property qualifications and creating the first full-time professional legion.
[03:54 --> 03:57] This was a major contributing factor to the death of the Republic
[03:57 --> 03:58] and the rise of the Imperium.
[04:00 --> 04:03] At this point in the podcast, we have reached one of those watershed moments,
[04:04 --> 04:08] the mid-300s BC, that saw a transition from one of these phases to another.
[04:09 --> 04:12] And this transition is particularly of vital importance
[04:12 --> 04:16] because it moved Rome from having just another classical Greek hoplite army
[04:16 --> 04:19] to having an army that was distinctly Roman.
[04:20 --> 04:24] The Romans, as I've mentioned, were heavily influenced by the Greeks,
[04:24 --> 04:28] not just in art and culture, but also in the employment of arms.
[04:29 --> 04:31] In the mid-7th and 8th centuries BC,
[04:31 --> 04:35] the Greeks adopted a formation of attack called the phalanx,
[04:35 --> 04:38] which was composed of individual soldiers called hoplites.
[04:39 --> 04:42] The phalanx was the most formidable method of attack in its day
[04:42 --> 04:44] and spread throughout the Mediterranean,
[04:44 --> 04:48] finding its way to Rome, as I said, around the mid-500s BC.
[04:49 --> 04:53] Put simply, the Greeks abandoned the chaotic charges of man-to-man fighting
[04:53 --> 04:55] in favor of a highly organized formation,
[04:56 --> 04:58] which would charge and engage the enemy as one.
[04:59 --> 05:02] For hundreds of years, the only thing that could stop a phalanx
[05:02 --> 05:04] was another phalanx of equal strength,
[05:04 --> 05:07] hence the speed of its adoption throughout the Western world.
[05:09 --> 05:13] A phalanx was composed of a single line, 8 to 16 men deep,
[05:13 --> 05:16] depending on the battlefield and number of hoplites available.
[05:17 --> 05:20] As a rule of thumb, deeper was better for phalanxes,
[05:20 --> 05:24] and there were accounts of phalanxes up to 50 men deep in some battles.
[05:25 --> 05:26] Commanders had to make hard choices, however,
[05:27 --> 05:30] because the line had to be long enough to prevent any outflanking maneuver,
[05:30 --> 05:32] which meant certain death,
[05:32 --> 05:35] so a balance was always sought between length and depth.
[05:36 --> 05:40] At Marathon, for example, the Greeks gambled by spreading their phalanx thin
[05:40 --> 05:43] to prevent the numerically superior Persians from outflanking them.
[05:44 --> 05:48] The gamble paid off, but the Persians nearly did break the thin Greek line,
[05:48 --> 05:49] and had they done so,
[05:49 --> 05:52] the history of the world would have been altered dramatically.
[05:54 --> 05:57] During battle, the men in the front line held their oval shields,
[05:57 --> 05:59] called hoplons, hence the name hoplite,
[06:00 --> 06:02] in their left hands and long spears in their right.
[06:03 --> 06:05] The hoplites stood close together,
[06:05 --> 06:08] and in such a way that their shield protected the men to their left,
[06:09 --> 06:11] and the men on their right protected them.
[06:12 --> 06:14] This formed a shield wall that was virtually impenetrable.
[06:15 --> 06:18] In between the shields, the spears of the second, third,
[06:19 --> 06:21] and sometimes fourth ranks shot through the gaps,
[06:22 --> 06:23] stabbing and gorging anything they could.
[06:25 --> 06:28] A mass of individual fighters would simply be massacred
[06:28 --> 06:29] if they attempted a head-on attack.
[06:29 --> 06:32] They would be unable to break through a well-disciplined phalanx.
[06:34 --> 06:35] Now I know what you're thinking.
[06:35 --> 06:39] If a phalanx was eight, or twelve, or sixteen men deep,
[06:39 --> 06:41] and only the front four lines were attacking,
[06:42 --> 06:44] what were the other four, eight, or twelve lines doing?
[06:45 --> 06:48] The answer is threefold, but all three folds relate
[06:48 --> 06:52] to the all-important task of maintaining the cohesion of the phalanx.
[06:53 --> 06:56] The first fold is that as the phalanx initially charged each other,
[06:56 --> 06:58] and in the subsequent shoving match,
[06:58 --> 07:01] the front lines had to be braced by the men behind them,
[07:02 --> 07:05] so they literally, physically, could not be pushed back.
[07:06 --> 07:09] The second fold is that the most common way a phalanx was broken
[07:09 --> 07:11] was by retreat from the rear.
[07:11 --> 07:13] Once men started running out the back,
[07:13 --> 07:16] there was no more bracing, no more support,
[07:16 --> 07:18] and the other army could push right through you.
[07:20 --> 07:22] A deep line meant removing those back ranks from danger,
[07:23 --> 07:25] and hence removing their desire to run away.
[07:25 --> 07:29] The man in the back line of a sixteen-man phalanx
[07:29 --> 07:31] was in no danger of being run through with a spear,
[07:31 --> 07:32] so he wasn't going to run.
[07:33 --> 07:34] It's basic psychology.
[07:35 --> 07:39] The third fold is that the stable back ranks prevented the men in front,
[07:39 --> 07:41] who really were in physical danger,
[07:41 --> 07:44] from running away even if they were scared out of their minds.
[07:45 --> 07:46] If anyone in the front ran,
[07:46 --> 07:49] then the whole phalanx would break down and everyone would be slaughtered.
[07:51 --> 07:52] Now I know what you're thinking again,
[07:52 --> 07:53] and the answer is yes.
[07:54 --> 07:58] The first few ranks of a phalanx was a really, really crappy place to be.
[07:58 --> 08:00] Trapped between an enemy who was trying to kill you
[08:00 --> 08:02] and friends who forced you to stay put,
[08:03 --> 08:05] even as they sat, essentially, on the sidelines.
[08:06 --> 08:08] The only way to live if you were in the front
[08:08 --> 08:10] was to stick together and move forward,
[08:11 --> 08:14] so there was a motivational element to the formation as well.
[08:15 --> 08:18] There was indeed a lot of psychology built into the phalanx.
[08:18 --> 08:21] Maybe all that philosophizing on the human condition paid off.
[08:22 --> 08:24] In a warrior society like Greece, though,
[08:24 --> 08:28] men clamored to be in the front ranks because that's where all the honor and glory was
[08:28 --> 08:30] and where the commanders placed their best men.
[08:31 --> 08:33] So, despite all the dangers,
[08:33 --> 08:35] they didn't think the front was such a bad place to be.
[08:36 --> 08:37] To each his own, I guess.
[08:39 --> 08:41] Now a last important word on the phalanx.
[08:41 --> 08:44] It was designed for and used on flat open plains
[08:44 --> 08:48] where the ranks could be deployed properly and there were no holes in the line.
[08:49 --> 08:51] In a phalanx, a single gap meant death.
[08:51 --> 08:56] The survival of the army was absolutely dependent on an unbroken shield wall.
[08:57 --> 09:00] In Greece, this worked well because both sides used phalanxes
[09:00 --> 09:03] and so both sought the same sort of terrain.
[09:03 --> 09:08] But against an army who used vastly different tactics on unstable hilly terrain,
[09:08 --> 09:12] the phalanx was vulnerable, a fact the Romans would learn the hard way.
[09:14 --> 09:17] In the hundreds of years that the Romans had used the standard phalanx,
[09:17 --> 09:21] they had been well served because they were fighting either other phalanxes
[09:21 --> 09:24] or gallic hordes who were no match for a solid shield wall
[09:24 --> 09:26] with hundreds of spears jetting out of it.
[09:27 --> 09:31] But when they met the Samnites, the weaknesses of the phalanx became all too apparent.
[09:32 --> 09:34] The steep, rough country of Samnium,
[09:34 --> 09:37] where most of the fighting of the Samnite wars took place,
[09:37 --> 09:41] made it difficult to deploy and maintain a cohesive phalanx.
[09:41 --> 09:45] Plus the Samnite light infantry and cavalry used to the terrain
[09:45 --> 09:47] were able to easily outflank the Romans.
[09:47 --> 09:51] And as I said, an outflanked phalanx was as good as dead.
[09:53 --> 09:56] This fatal flaw spelled the end of the Roman use of the phalanx.
[09:56 --> 09:58] It was simply not maneuverable enough.
[09:59 --> 10:01] When attacking head on, a phalanx was indestructible,
[10:02 --> 10:05] but once hit from the side or back, it was a sitting duck.
[10:06 --> 10:08] The densely packed soldiers simply could not turn
[10:08 --> 10:11] and set up the critical defense of shield wall in time
[10:11 --> 10:14] and cumbered as they were with heavy armor and long spears.
[10:14 --> 10:16] If given enough time,
[10:16 --> 10:19] the left or right hand column could reform into a front line.
[10:19 --> 10:21] But in battle time was measured in seconds
[10:21 --> 10:24] and a cavalry detachment that managed to get around the line
[10:24 --> 10:26] was charging through the ranks in a heartbeat,
[10:27 --> 10:29] slaughtering the closely packed hoplites
[10:29 --> 10:31] who could not even turn around to defend themselves.
[10:32 --> 10:35] This was why the phalanx had to avoid being outflanked at all costs
[10:35 --> 10:39] and why when the Samnites proved they could get around the Romans,
[10:39 --> 10:42] the Romans changed forever their organizational deployment
[10:42 --> 10:44] to develop an immunity to this chronic disease.
[10:46 --> 10:49] What the Romans developed was the system that has been handed down
[10:49 --> 10:51] as the classic Republican army formation,
[10:52 --> 10:54] which we will talk about in detail next week.
[10:54 --> 10:57] The maniple system and its three-line deployment,
[10:57 --> 11:00] famously referred to as a phalanx with joints.

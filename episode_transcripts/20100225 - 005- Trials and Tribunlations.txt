[00:03 --> 00:06] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:13] Last week, we discussed the transitional year of 509 BC, when Rome went from being a typical
[00:13 --> 00:16] Italian kingdom to an atypical Italian republic.
[00:17 --> 00:20] Though the actual workings of the republic were not as democratic as they appeared
[00:20 --> 00:24] on the surface, the fact remained that the monarchy had been abolished and annual
[00:24 --> 00:26] elections now determined leadership.
[00:27 --> 00:31] The first years after the change would prove difficult for the new government, for it faced
[00:31 --> 00:33] both internal dissension and external invasion.
[00:34 --> 00:38] Those years would see the final defeat of the Tarquans, the re-subduing of Latium,
[00:39 --> 00:43] and finally the extension of political rights to the Plebes with the creation of the
[00:43 --> 00:46] Office of Tribune, the plebeian answer to the patrician consulship.
[00:48 --> 00:55] After his Viet army was defeated, the ex-king Tarquan next took refuge in the
[00:57 --> 01:00] Tarquan begged Porsenna to attack the Romans, repeating his line about the threat
[01:00 --> 01:05] democracy posed to royalty everywhere and the necessity of returning a king to the
[01:05 --> 01:05] throne.
[01:06 --> 01:10] Porsenna, like the Viet, no doubt took this argument under advisement, but when
[01:10 --> 01:14] he agreed to make war with the Romans, he did so ultimately for his own reasons.
[01:15 --> 01:17] There are two accounts of what happened next.
[01:17 --> 01:22] Either Porsenna invaded and was successfully repulsed, or he invaded and captured the
[01:22 --> 01:22] city.
[01:23 --> 01:28] The former is alleged by Roman folktales, the latter is supported by modern historical
[01:28 --> 01:28] analysis.
[01:30 --> 01:34] According to the legendary tradition, Porsenna, in defense of his fellow Etruscan king
[01:34 --> 01:38] Tarquan, marched south and was met by the Roman forces at the Tiber.
[01:39 --> 01:44] The Romans, seeing the size of the Etruscan army, fled back across the river, leaving
[01:44 --> 01:47] the bridge, and therefore the city, unguarded.
[01:47 --> 01:52] A single Roman soldier named Horatius, realizing he could not prevent the army's
[01:52 --> 01:56] fight, ordered men to set fire to the bridge in order to prevent the Etruscans from
[01:56 --> 01:58] crossing and sacking the city.
[01:58 --> 02:02] To buy time, he stood alone on the far side of the bridge and challenged the
[02:02 --> 02:04] whole of Porsenna's army to combat.
[02:05 --> 02:08] While the dumb-struck Etruscans tried to figure out what they should do with
[02:08 --> 02:13] this crazy, brave, but clearly suicidal soldier, the other Romans set fire to
[02:13 --> 02:14] the wooden bridge.
[02:14 --> 02:18] The Etruscans were finally snapped out of their stupor when the burning bridge
[02:18 --> 02:22] collapsed into the river and attacked, but Horatius jumped in the river and swam
[02:22 --> 02:27] unscathed to the other side, saving the city and enrolling himself in the
[02:27 --> 02:29] pantheon of great Roman heroes.
[02:30 --> 02:34] Porsenna was forced to initiate a siege, which proved no more effective than his
[02:34 --> 02:38] initial assault, again due to the bravery of a single Roman citizen.
[02:38 --> 02:43] This time it was Mucius Scavola, who proved his valor and secured ultimate
[02:43 --> 02:44] victory for Rome.
[02:44 --> 02:47] The city was suffering under Porsenna's siege and showed no sign to
[02:47 --> 02:49] being able to fight it off.
[02:49 --> 02:53] Mucius, taking matters into his own hand, crossed over to the Etruscan camp.
[02:53 --> 02:57] He made his way to Porsenna's headquarters and waited for an opportunity
[02:57 --> 02:57] to strike.
[02:58 --> 03:02] When Porsenna's entourage emerged, Mucius attempted to assassinate the king,
[03:02 --> 03:06] but, unsure of who his target was, mistakenly attacked one of the
[03:06 --> 03:07] king's secretaries.
[03:08 --> 03:11] Mucius was seized and dragged before the shaken king.
[03:11 --> 03:15] What happened next would be the stuff of Roman legend and a moral story
[03:15 --> 03:18] to inspire generation upon generation of future citizens.
[03:19 --> 03:23] Mucius told the king that the Romans had declared war not on the men of
[03:23 --> 03:26] Colusium, but upon Porsenna personally, and that he was merely the
[03:26 --> 03:29] first in a long line of assassins who would not stop until the king
[03:29 --> 03:30] was dead.
[03:31 --> 03:36] The king, unnerved by this idea, ordered Mucius burned alive and found
[03:36 --> 03:39] himself only further unnerved by what Mucius did next.
[03:39 --> 03:43] The Romans stuck his right hand into the fire and, without flinching,
[03:43 --> 03:44] allowed it to burn.
[03:45 --> 03:48] He declared that such was the regard Roman men held for their bodies and
[03:48 --> 03:51] that the king should remember what lay in store for him.
[03:52 --> 03:55] Porsenna was, to say the least, impressed and very freaked out.
[03:56 --> 03:59] He allowed Mucius to go free, commending the man for his bravery.
[03:59 --> 04:02] And not wishing to live his life under a death sentence from a
[04:02 --> 04:05] bunch of psychotic patriot assassins, he made peace with
[04:05 --> 04:08] Rome and lifted the siege, never having taken the city.
[04:08 --> 04:10] This was the official legend.
[04:11 --> 04:15] Other, non-Roman sources tell a different, more plausible story.
[04:15 --> 04:18] In this version, Porsenna did indeed take Rome in the turbulent
[04:18 --> 04:21] years after the founding of the republic and set up a puppet
[04:21 --> 04:22] government.
[04:22 --> 04:25] The outcome seems reasonable in that the Etruscans of Colusium
[04:25 --> 04:28] would have been much stronger and far better equipped than the
[04:28 --> 04:31] Romans were at this point, and resistance would have been futile
[04:31 --> 04:31] at best.
[04:32 --> 04:35] The reason Porsenna, who is a confirmed historical figure,
[04:35 --> 04:38] invaded Rome is a further divide between fact and legend.
[04:39 --> 04:42] The melodrama of Tarquin's plea for Etruscan solidarity is
[04:42 --> 04:46] pure fiction, as is the decisiveness of individual Roman
[04:46 --> 04:46] bravery.
[04:47 --> 04:51] Population upheaval in Italy around 500 BC had resulted in an
[04:51 --> 04:54] estrangement between Etruria and their Greek trading
[04:54 --> 04:55] partners in the south.
[04:56 --> 04:58] Specifically, Etruscan trade routes were disrupted by the
[04:58 --> 05:01] Volscians, a central Italian hill tribe who settled the
[05:01 --> 05:04] plains between Etruria and Magna Graecia south of Rome.
[05:05 --> 05:08] Porsenna's conquest of the Romans was just a step in the
[05:08 --> 05:11] greater project of maintaining the safety of the southern
[05:11 --> 05:12] trade roads from attack.
[05:13 --> 05:15] Disabusing the notion that the war had been waged on
[05:15 --> 05:18] Tarquin's behalf, Porsenna left his son in charge of
[05:18 --> 05:20] matters in Latium after defeating Rome.
[05:21 --> 05:23] His son, though, was defeated by an army of allied
[05:23 --> 05:26] Latins and driven back north, re-securing independence
[05:26 --> 05:28] for Rome as an unintended byproduct.
[05:29 --> 05:31] The Latin communities emerged strong from the encounter,
[05:31 --> 05:35] and Rome humbled, setting up a major confrontation for
[05:35 --> 05:38] control of central Italy that would ultimately see Rome
[05:38 --> 05:40] re-emerge as the dominant force in Latium for another
[05:40 --> 05:42] 150 years.
[05:43 --> 05:46] The Latins had chafed under Roman rule during the reign
[05:46 --> 05:49] of the Tarquins and took the opportunity presented by
[05:49 --> 05:51] Rome's weakened position to attempt a redrawing of the
[05:51 --> 05:52] political landscape.
[05:53 --> 05:56] Disorganized by Porsenna's invasion and a lack of
[05:56 --> 05:59] internal political unity, Rome seemed easy pickings for
[05:59 --> 06:00] the emboldened Latins.
[06:00 --> 06:04] But they underestimated Rome's will, a common mistake
[06:04 --> 06:06] made by enemies of the empire for years to come.
[06:07 --> 06:09] An alliance of Latin communities broke from the
[06:09 --> 06:12] Romans and forced the issue into an armed conflict,
[06:12 --> 06:15] which they thought would see them master Rome, but
[06:15 --> 06:18] instead it led them right back under the yoke.
[06:18 --> 06:21] A decisive battle was fought near Lake Regilis,
[06:21 --> 06:22] southeast of Rome.
[06:22 --> 06:24] And though the details of the fight are unimportant,
[06:25 --> 06:27] the Battle of Lake Regilis is important for two
[06:27 --> 06:27] reasons.
[06:27 --> 06:31] First, as I mentioned, it ended Latin resistance to
[06:31 --> 06:34] Rome for another 150 years, until, embroiled in a long
[06:34 --> 06:37] war with the Samnites, Rome was again seen as
[06:37 --> 06:38] vulnerable enough to resist.
[06:39 --> 06:42] Second, it marked the first time that a dictator led a
[06:42 --> 06:43] Roman army in battle.
[06:45 --> 06:47] The office of dictator was a curious instrument to find
[06:47 --> 06:50] within the constitution of a republic, but the
[06:50 --> 06:52] Romans felt that extraordinary emergencies
[06:52 --> 06:55] called for extraordinary solutions, and dictators
[06:55 --> 06:57] who were appointed periodically over the years
[06:57 --> 06:58] when such emergencies arose.
[06:59 --> 07:02] Basically, a dictator was appointed when all the
[07:02 --> 07:05] red tape needed to be cut through, and one single
[07:05 --> 07:07] man needed to take decisive action now,
[07:08 --> 07:10] without complaint or appeal or challenge.
[07:11 --> 07:13] According to law, a dictator could be appointed
[07:13 --> 07:15] for one six-month term, at the end of which he
[07:15 --> 07:18] would resign and power revert back to the
[07:18 --> 07:18] consuls.
[07:19 --> 07:21] At the beginning of his term, the dictator
[07:21 --> 07:23] appointed a vice-dictator, called his
[07:23 --> 07:26] master of horse, who was accountable to no one but
[07:26 --> 07:27] the dictator himself.
[07:28 --> 07:30] The Romans were sufficiently distressed by the
[07:30 --> 07:32] hostility of the Latins that they used their
[07:32 --> 07:34] extraordinary solution for the first time to lead
[07:34 --> 07:37] an army against a foreign threat, and
[07:37 --> 07:39] technically the first dictator ever appointed had
[07:39 --> 07:42] been a man named Titus Lardius, who had served
[07:42 --> 07:44] briefly in that position two years before to
[07:44 --> 07:47] quote internal riots, but beyond trivia, the
[07:47 --> 07:48] event is hardly worth mentioning.
[07:49 --> 07:51] The appointment of a Louis Postjumish, however,
[07:51 --> 07:53] was a watershed moment.
[07:54 --> 07:56] Lardius' appointment had been a ploy used by the
[07:56 --> 07:58] patricians to put the fear of God back into the
[07:58 --> 08:01] plebes, which of course it did, but there was
[08:01 --> 08:03] never any question of actually instilling him
[08:03 --> 08:05] with dictatorial powers for any period of time.
[08:06 --> 08:08] Postjumius, however, was given the keys to the
[08:08 --> 08:11] city and told to do whatever was necessary to
[08:11 --> 08:13] defeat the Latins, essentially that he was
[08:13 --> 08:14] now a law unto himself.
[08:16 --> 08:18] Postjumius did indeed lead the army to
[08:18 --> 08:20] victory over the Latins, and then, in a
[08:20 --> 08:23] remarkable display of constitutional loyalty,
[08:23 --> 08:25] stepped down from the heady heights of absolute
[08:25 --> 08:28] dictatorship and restored the consuls to their
[08:28 --> 08:29] rightful positions.
[08:30 --> 08:32] The remarkable giving up of power demonstrates
[08:32 --> 08:35] both Postjumius' personal honor and the
[08:35 --> 08:37] extent to which Rome as a whole probably would
[08:37 --> 08:39] have cried out for his murder if he had
[08:39 --> 08:40] considered remaining in power.
[08:41 --> 08:43] The monarchy really was dead, and though
[08:43 --> 08:45] dictators would be appointed off and on for
[08:45 --> 08:48] the next 450 years, it was not until Julius
[08:48 --> 08:50] Caesar that a dictator did not ultimately
[08:50 --> 08:52] resign of his own free will.
[08:54 --> 08:55] The Latins reconquered and the dictatorship
[08:55 --> 08:56] passed.
[08:57 --> 08:59] Rome found itself at peace, and as a
[08:59 --> 09:01] general rule, whenever Rome found itself at
[09:01 --> 09:04] peace abroad, it immediately found itself
[09:04 --> 09:04] divided at home.
[09:05 --> 09:08] The question of plebeian rights, never
[09:08 --> 09:10] satisfactorily settled, now reared its
[09:10 --> 09:11] head once again.
[09:12 --> 09:14] The plebes were not to be put off this time.
[09:14 --> 09:16] No amount of patrician chicanery and backroom
[09:16 --> 09:18] dealing would break their solidarity.
[09:19 --> 09:21] Only rights guaranteed by law would
[09:21 --> 09:22] satisfy them now.
[09:22 --> 09:24] The plebes would ultimately win political
[09:24 --> 09:26] concessions from the patricians, though
[09:26 --> 09:28] it took the first recorded strike in
[09:28 --> 09:29] history to do so.
[09:30 --> 09:32] Trouble arose over the matter of debt
[09:32 --> 09:32] bonding.
[09:33 --> 09:35] In Roman law at the time, if a debtor
[09:35 --> 09:36] could not pay his creditor, then he
[09:36 --> 09:38] became a bonded servant to the creditor
[09:38 --> 09:39] until the debt was repaid.
[09:40 --> 09:42] The system of indentured servitude
[09:42 --> 09:44] essentially made permanent slaves of the
[09:44 --> 09:46] debtors because, while servants to the
[09:46 --> 09:48] creditors, they were unable to earn
[09:48 --> 09:50] any money to pay off their debts.
[09:51 --> 09:52] Many of the soldiers who fought in the
[09:52 --> 09:54] recent war against the Latins found
[09:54 --> 09:55] themselves bonded in this way.
[09:56 --> 09:58] The practice in this case was especially
[09:58 --> 10:00] egregious because the debts were incurred
[10:00 --> 10:01] while the men were off fighting in
[10:01 --> 10:03] patriotic defense of the city.
[10:04 --> 10:06] The plebes agitated for debt relief
[10:06 --> 10:08] but were rebuffed by the patricians,
[10:08 --> 10:10] whose attitude was basically, you take
[10:10 --> 10:12] on the debt, you pay the price.
[10:13 --> 10:14] Offended by this high-handed
[10:14 --> 10:16] treatment, the plebes were on the
[10:16 --> 10:18] verge of full-blown revolt when the
[10:18 --> 10:19] city suddenly found itself under
[10:19 --> 10:20] attack from all sides.
[10:21 --> 10:24] The Sabines, Volshans, and Aquians all
[10:24 --> 10:26] began making forays into Roman
[10:26 --> 10:28] territory and the Senate called for
[10:28 --> 10:29] armies to be raised.
[10:30 --> 10:32] The plebes sensed an opportunity and
[10:32 --> 10:33] when the consuls began calling names
[10:33 --> 10:35] for enlistment, not one of them made
[10:35 --> 10:35] a move.
[10:36 --> 10:38] The Senate was basically beside itself
[10:38 --> 10:40] at this mass act of treason and
[10:40 --> 10:42] immediately appointed a dictator to
[10:42 --> 10:43] smash the resistance.
[10:43 --> 10:45] But at an amazing display of
[10:45 --> 10:47] moderation and wisdom, they appointed
[10:47 --> 10:49] the brother of Publius Publicoa,
[10:49 --> 10:51] Manlius Valerius, whom the plebes
[10:51 --> 10:52] loved, to the office.
[10:53 --> 10:54] Valerius begged the plebes to do
[10:54 --> 10:56] their duty and enlist, promising
[10:56 --> 10:58] that once hostilities were concluded,
[10:58 --> 11:00] the issue of debt relief would be
[11:00 --> 11:01] addressed straight away.
[11:02 --> 11:03] Swayed by Valerius, they
[11:03 --> 11:04] relented and legions were formed.
[11:05 --> 11:06] In due course, all three foreign
[11:06 --> 11:08] threats were put down and the
[11:08 --> 11:09] legions returned to Rome.
[11:10 --> 11:11] Back in the city, however,
[11:12 --> 11:13] Valerius was unable to fulfill
[11:13 --> 11:14] his promise.
[11:14 --> 11:16] The patrician senators blocked
[11:16 --> 11:17] his attempts at debt relief and
[11:17 --> 11:19] Valerius resigned his office,
[11:19 --> 11:20] laying at the Senate's feet all
[11:20 --> 11:22] domestic turmoil that would ensue
[11:22 --> 11:24] as a result of their decision.
[11:25 --> 11:26] The disbanded legionnaires were
[11:26 --> 11:28] outraged at the betrayal and took
[11:28 --> 11:30] an extraordinary step that would
[11:30 --> 11:31] become known to history as the
[11:31 --> 11:33] secession of the plebes.
[11:34 --> 11:35] The soldiers marched en masse to
[11:35 --> 11:37] the sacred mount, a hill three
[11:37 --> 11:39] miles from Rome, and set up a
[11:39 --> 11:41] fortified camp, refusing to return
[11:41 --> 11:42] to the city until their demands
[11:42 --> 11:43] were met.
[11:44 --> 11:45] The population of the city flew
[11:45 --> 11:46] into a panic.
[11:46 --> 11:48] The remaining plebes feared
[11:48 --> 11:49] retaliatory violence from the
[11:49 --> 11:51] patricians, and conversely, the
[11:51 --> 11:52] patricians feared runaway mob
[11:52 --> 11:54] violence without the army around
[11:54 --> 11:55] to maintain order.
[11:56 --> 11:57] And what they both feared the
[11:57 --> 11:59] most was external invasion.
[11:59 --> 12:00] If word got out that Rome's
[12:00 --> 12:02] army had abandoned her, every
[12:02 --> 12:03] two-bit tribe in the
[12:03 --> 12:04] neighborhood would come knocking
[12:04 --> 12:06] on the city gates and Rome would
[12:06 --> 12:07] be at their mercy.
[12:08 --> 12:10] So the Senate relented and
[12:10 --> 12:11] sent an envoy to the plebe
[12:11 --> 12:12] camp to broker a deal.
[12:13 --> 12:14] The settlement did not address
[12:14 --> 12:15] the debt question directly.
[12:16 --> 12:18] Rather, a new office was
[12:18 --> 12:19] created to shield the plebes
[12:19 --> 12:20] from future patrician tyranny,
[12:21 --> 12:22] the tribunate.
[12:23 --> 12:24] The dangerous precedent set by
[12:24 --> 12:26] the strike was pointed out to
[12:26 --> 12:27] the plebes by the patrician
[12:27 --> 12:28] envoy who compared the
[12:28 --> 12:29] republic to a body.
[12:30 --> 12:31] It is true, he told them,
[12:31 --> 12:33] the hands and feet and mouth
[12:33 --> 12:35] could join forces and stop
[12:35 --> 12:36] working for the lazy stomach
[12:36 --> 12:38] who sat there greedily
[12:38 --> 12:39] receiving all the food the
[12:39 --> 12:40] other parts worked for.
[12:41 --> 12:42] But if they were to do so,
[12:42 --> 12:43] the entire body would soon
[12:43 --> 12:44] die of starvation,
[12:45 --> 12:46] for the stomach pumped energy
[12:46 --> 12:47] back out into the limbs.
[12:48 --> 12:49] The plebes would be granted
[12:49 --> 12:50] more rights to end the
[12:50 --> 12:52] secession, the envoy said,
[12:52 --> 12:54] but they must not think in
[12:54 --> 12:55] the future that starving the
[12:55 --> 12:56] stomach was in their
[12:56 --> 12:57] enlightened best interest.
[12:58 --> 12:59] The plebes took some note of
[12:59 --> 13:01] this, but were so absorbed
[13:01 --> 13:02] with their success that it is
[13:02 --> 13:03] doubtful the lesson
[13:03 --> 13:04] fully sank in.
[13:05 --> 13:06] The role of tribune was
[13:06 --> 13:07] defensive in nature.
[13:08 --> 13:09] Two plebian men would be
[13:09 --> 13:10] elected each year to act
[13:10 --> 13:12] as a counterweight to the
[13:12 --> 13:12] consuls.
[13:13 --> 13:14] Initially the power of
[13:14 --> 13:15] the tribunes was modestly
[13:15 --> 13:17] held to the right to free
[13:17 --> 13:17] any man from
[13:17 --> 13:19] patrician imprisonment,
[13:19 --> 13:20] though in the future they
[13:20 --> 13:21] would gain the right to
[13:21 --> 13:23] veto, literally I forbid,
[13:24 --> 13:25] any law passed by the
[13:25 --> 13:26] consuls or the Senate
[13:26 --> 13:27] at a word.
[13:28 --> 13:29] The tribunes were also
[13:29 --> 13:31] granted sacrosanctity,
[13:31 --> 13:32] or the right to be free
[13:32 --> 13:33] from harm.
[13:33 --> 13:35] The plebes took a solemn
[13:35 --> 13:36] oath to kill any man who
[13:36 --> 13:37] attempted to assault a
[13:37 --> 13:39] tribune, and more than
[13:39 --> 13:40] once that oath was
[13:40 --> 13:40] fulfilled.
[13:41 --> 13:42] The tribune would become
[13:42 --> 13:43] a flashpoint for Roman
[13:43 --> 13:45] politics for the remainder
[13:45 --> 13:45] of the republic.
[13:46 --> 13:47] The eventual power to
[13:47 --> 13:49] veto led to a number of
[13:49 --> 13:50] showdowns with the
[13:50 --> 13:51] patricians, both sides
[13:51 --> 13:52] bloodying themselves in
[13:52 --> 13:53] their attempts to control
[13:53 --> 13:54] state policy.
[13:55 --> 13:56] The power of the office
[13:56 --> 13:57] would peak with the
[13:57 --> 13:58] Gracchi brothers around
[13:58 --> 14:00] 125 BC and fall into
[14:00 --> 14:01] obsolescence with the
[14:01 --> 14:02] ascension of the
[14:02 --> 14:03] caesars.
[14:03 --> 14:04] But for the bulk of
[14:04 --> 14:05] the republican period it
[14:05 --> 14:06] was an important and
[14:06 --> 14:07] powerful office.
[14:07 --> 14:08] The tribunes would be
[14:08 --> 14:09] elected by a new
[14:09 --> 14:11] assembly called the
[14:11 --> 14:12] Commida Tributa, which
[14:12 --> 14:13] would be made up of the
[14:13 --> 14:15] now 35 tribes of Rome.
[14:16 --> 14:17] Suffrage in the
[14:17 --> 14:18] assembly was not based
[14:18 --> 14:20] on property assessment as
[14:20 --> 14:21] it was with the
[14:21 --> 14:23] Centuriata, and so the
[14:23 --> 14:24] Commida Tributa was
[14:24 --> 14:26] as democratic a form as
[14:26 --> 14:27] Rome would ever see.
[14:28 --> 14:29] The secession of the
[14:29 --> 14:30] plebes occurred in
[14:30 --> 14:32] 494 BC, about fifteen
[14:32 --> 14:34] years after the birth
[14:34 --> 14:34] of the republic.
[14:35 --> 14:36] Though domestic
[14:36 --> 14:37] combustion and foreign
[14:37 --> 14:38] invasion were constant
[14:38 --> 14:39] threats, the republican
[14:39 --> 14:40] passed through its
[14:40 --> 14:42] infancy and emerged as
[14:42 --> 14:43] an adolescent power
[14:43 --> 14:44] ready for fresh
[14:44 --> 14:45] challenges.
[14:46 --> 14:47] Any threat posed by
[14:47 --> 14:48] the ex-king Tarquin
[14:48 --> 14:49] was gone, and
[14:49 --> 14:50] monarchy was now
[14:50 --> 14:51] firmly in the rearview
[14:51 --> 14:51] mirror.
[14:52 --> 14:52] The attempted
[14:52 --> 14:53] revolt by the
[14:53 --> 14:54] Latin communities had
[14:54 --> 14:55] been suppressed by a
[14:55 --> 14:57] republican army, and
[14:57 --> 14:57] Rome managed to
[14:57 --> 14:58] maintain control of
[14:58 --> 15:00] Latium just as it
[15:00 --> 15:00] had while a
[15:00 --> 15:01] monarchy.
[15:02 --> 15:02] The patricians and
[15:02 --> 15:03] plebes were settled
[15:03 --> 15:04] in an alliance,
[15:05 --> 15:05] uneasy though it may
[15:05 --> 15:06] have been, and the
[15:06 --> 15:07] population was more or
[15:07 --> 15:08] less at peace with
[15:08 --> 15:09] itself.
[15:10 --> 15:11] Next week we will cover
[15:11 --> 15:12] the creation of the
[15:12 --> 15:12] final piece of the
[15:12 --> 15:14] republican puzzle, the
[15:14 --> 15:15] Law of the Twelve
[15:15 --> 15:16] Tables, as well as
[15:16 --> 15:17] discuss the rising
[15:17 --> 15:18] threat posed by
[15:18 --> 15:19] the Volscians, which
[15:19 --> 15:20] caused the Romans to
[15:20 --> 15:21] make their first
[15:21 --> 15:22] concerted forays into
[15:22 --> 15:24] the eastern hills where
[15:24 --> 15:25] they would fight the
[15:25 --> 15:25] wars that would
[15:25 --> 15:26] ultimately win them
[15:26 --> 15:28] control of all Italy.

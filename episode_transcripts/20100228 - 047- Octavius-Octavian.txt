[00:04 --> 00:15] Hello and welcome to the history of Rome episode 47 Octavius Octavian Julius Caesar was dead
[00:15 --> 00:20] upon hearing the news the people of Rome shut themselves up in their homes after years
[00:20 --> 00:25] of civil war peace had finally come to the turbulent capital but now Caesar's final
[00:25 --> 00:28] settlement turned out to be little more than the eye of the hurricane.
[00:28 --> 00:33] The people implicitly understood that the liberators vision of a restored republic would
[00:33 --> 00:39] mean little more than the return of violent chaos so they did not rush to embrace Cassius
[00:39 --> 00:43] they did not cheer for Brutus they simply turned their backs resigning themselves
[00:43 --> 00:50] to what was clearly this generations lot in life pain sacrifice and bloodshed and not
[00:50 --> 00:55] only did the people of Rome get it exactly right that Caesar's murder would lead to renewed
[00:55 --> 01:01] strife but the liberators got it exactly wrong far from restoring the old republican order the
[01:01 --> 01:08] assassination of Julius Caesar hastened its demise. The liberators made three basic intertwined
[01:08 --> 01:14] mistakes first and foremost they had no plan for what to do after Caesar was dead in a
[01:14 --> 01:18] classic display of not thinking through the consequences of one's actions they were so
[01:18 --> 01:22] obsessed with removing the dictator that they did not think about who would fill the power
[01:22 --> 01:27] when he was gone it seems not to have occurred to them to make arrangements for someone anyone
[01:27 --> 01:32] to assume executive power once the man who had consolidated nearly all executive power into his
[01:32 --> 01:37] hands was gone it was a palace coup without a replacement king waiting in the wings
[01:38 --> 01:43] and this exposed their second great mistake focusing all their attention on Caesar.
[01:43 --> 01:48] In the moments after the assassination Mark Antony fled from Pompey's theater disguised
[01:48 --> 01:52] himself as a slave and fled the city convinced that he would be a target of assassination
[01:52 --> 01:57] himself. When you depose a ruler it's just common sense to purge his supporters at the same
[01:57 --> 02:02] time otherwise they come back and undo everything you were trying to accomplish by deposing the
[02:02 --> 02:07] ruler in the first place which is of course exactly what Antony did a few days later when
[02:07 --> 02:13] he realized no one was out to get him. As consul for that year an unharmed Mark Antony
[02:13 --> 02:17] had every legitimate reason to step into the power vacuum left by Caesar's death.
[02:18 --> 02:22] If the liberators thought they were going to restore the republic by letting Mark Antony
[02:22 --> 02:28] anywhere near power they were mistaken ordering on delusional. As Cicero later said the Ides of
[02:28 --> 02:33] March was a fine deed but half done letting Antony live was incredibly short-sighted.
[02:35 --> 02:39] Finally the assassins completely miscalculated the people's reaction to the death of Caesar.
[02:40 --> 02:45] The liberators who were all highborn senators seemed to have been living in something of a
[02:45 --> 02:50] bubble. They saw Caesar as a dangerous tyrant removing him from power was a self-evident
[02:51 --> 02:56] but the lower and middle classes saw Caesar not as a dangerous tyrant but as a powerful advocate
[02:56 --> 03:01] of their interests. A man who had always gone to bat for them against the oligarchy of wealthy
[03:01 --> 03:06] princes who never gave them the time of day who gobbled up their land hoarded the profits of
[03:06 --> 03:11] empire and forced them to live wretched lives in urban slums. If the liberators thought
[03:11 --> 03:14] murdering Caesar was going to make them heroes to the people they understood nothing
[03:14 --> 03:19] about how the average Roman lived. They would pay a price for their blindness in just
[03:19 --> 03:24] a matter of days these men who thought themselves heroes who believed they had just delivered
[03:24 --> 03:28] Rome from one of history's greatest monsters would find themselves on the run their homes
[03:28 --> 03:35] ransacked and their heads called for by the enraged masses of Rome.
[03:35 --> 03:39] Perplexed and perhaps a bit offended that the liberators had not thought him worthy of
[03:39 --> 03:44] assassination Mark Antony returned to Rome a few days after the Ides of March quietly
[03:44 --> 03:49] reassuming the consulship which with Caesar now gone was once again the highest office in
[03:49 --> 03:54] land. The first order of business was to open Caesar's will and find out how the late dictator
[03:54 --> 03:59] planned to allocate his power and fortune. Calpurnia had retrieved the documents from
[03:59 --> 04:03] their deposit box at the temple of the Vestas and turned them over to Antony as
[04:03 --> 04:08] soon as he was back in the city. What Antony read disheartened him. Despite his years of
[04:08 --> 04:13] service and loyalty he was accorded no official place among Caesar's heirs. Instead
[04:13 --> 04:19] incredibly Caesar left three quarters of his fortune to his practically unknown and certainly
[04:19 --> 04:25] untested 19 year old great nephew Gaius Octavius. Even more incredibly Caesar stipulated in the will
[04:25 --> 04:31] that he was adopting Octavius posthumously. Just like that Antony was faced with a dangerous
[04:31 --> 04:36] rival for power. He had assumed that with their old general dead the loyalty of Caesar's
[04:36 --> 04:41] legions would naturally pass to his chief lieutenant but now suddenly there was a son
[04:41 --> 04:46] of Caesar. Would the legions rally to this upstart or would they stick with the man who
[04:46 --> 04:49] had shared their barracks and mess tents through all these long years of war and
[04:49 --> 04:55] hardship? It was not a rhetorical question. Across the empire the legions who had pledged
[04:55 --> 05:01] themselves personally to Caesar would now be faced with a choice the son or the best friend.
[05:03 --> 05:08] Gaius Octavius the man who would become Caesar Augustus was born during the consulship
[05:08 --> 05:14] of Cicero in 63 BC. He was the son of an up and coming novice homo also named Gaius Octavius
[05:14 --> 05:19] who had been recognized as a rising star and married to Julius Caesar's niece Attia.
[05:20 --> 05:24] However when young Gaius was only five his father had died and his mother remarried a
[05:24 --> 05:30] cautious politician named Lucius Marcius Philippus. His early years were spent primarily
[05:30 --> 05:34] in the care of his grandmother Caesar's sister Julia who oversaw his education until
[05:34 --> 05:41] she died in 51 BC. There do not seem to be anything particularly remarkable about the boy
[05:41 --> 05:45] certainly nothing to indicate that in a few years he would become I don't know the master
[05:45 --> 05:50] of the known world. In fact he seemed to lack all the qualities that mark young Roman
[05:50 --> 05:56] boys for greatness. He was fragile prone to sickness not particularly strong and forever
[05:56 --> 06:01] hovered over by an overprotective mother. But he was an able student showed promise
[06:01 --> 06:07] and most critically seemed to attract the right kind of friends. It was at school for example
[06:07 --> 06:12] that he met Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa the lowborn son of a nobody who was immediately
[06:12 --> 06:18] drawn to the thoughtful if frail young aristocrat. Agrippa was everything that Octavius
[06:18 --> 06:23] was not a physically gifted natural athlete who impressed every old soldier he ever came across.
[06:24 --> 06:31] As much as Caesar was eventually struck by the clever mind and solid character of his
[06:31 --> 06:36] the boy's physical prowess but in the friends Octavius surrounded himself with Agrippa in
[06:36 --> 06:42] particular Caesar felt comforted that the boy was in good hands. Indeed throughout the coming
[06:42 --> 06:47] civil wars when Octavian is described as having won this or that battle what historians really
[06:47 --> 06:53] mean to say is that Agrippa won this or that battle for Octavian. The childhood friends
[06:53 --> 06:58] conquered the empire together Octavian handling the politics Agrippa the armies. It was one of
[06:58 --> 07:05] most successful partnerships in history. Young Octavius did not come into regular
[07:05 --> 07:09] contact with his famous uncle until Caesar returned triumphant from North Africa.
[07:10 --> 07:14] He had been forbidden to join the campaign by his mother who feared the boy would break
[07:14 --> 07:18] under the stress of army life. But when Caesar emerged victorious from the civil war
[07:18 --> 07:22] Octavius found himself in the unique position of being related to the most powerful man in
[07:23 --> 07:29] He was bombarded from all sides by people looking to use his special access to procure favors
[07:29 --> 07:35] appointments and handouts. But at the time he was basically just a kid and had no reason to
[07:35 --> 07:39] think he had any pull whatsoever with his uncle. So what the heck were they bothering him
[07:39 --> 07:44] for? Famously though Octavius finally mustered the gumption to approach Caesar and ask a
[07:44 --> 07:49] favor. Agrippa's brother had been on the losing side of the North African war but
[07:49 --> 07:54] having already been pardoned by Caesar once before he had no hope of clemency as it was
[07:54 --> 07:59] well known that Caesar's generosity was extended one time only getting caught on the wrong side
[07:59 --> 08:04] a second time meant death. Caesar granted the request of his young nephew without
[08:04 --> 08:08] hesitation though to the relief of both Octavius who feared provoking the wrath of his uncle
[08:08 --> 08:14] and Agrippa whose brother's life hung in the balance. That Octavius took such a personal risk
[08:15 --> 08:20] cemented their bond forever and earned Octavius a well-deserved reputation for loyalty.
[08:22 --> 08:26] Without a legitimate male heir Caesar had his eye on Octavius and when the Pompey brothers
[08:26 --> 08:31] started trouble in Spain he intended to place the young man on his general staff and test his
[08:31 --> 08:37] military medal. But as the legions were preparing to march from Rome Octavius was felled by one
[08:37 --> 08:42] of his frequent sicknesses and had to be left behind. Unfortunately for Octavius his early
[08:42 --> 08:47] career would be riddled by these untimely sicknesses. You know the kind of sicknesses
[08:47 --> 08:52] that keep you confined to a tent when you should be out on the battlefield. So whether
[08:52 --> 08:56] deserved or not along with his reputation for loyalty young Octavius will soon acquire
[08:56 --> 09:01] a damaging reputation for cowardice as well. There is no indication that he was ever faking
[09:01 --> 09:06] sick but once too often the legions marched off and left him behind to mend from some
[09:06 --> 09:13] new affliction. Eventually people started to notice a pattern. But Octavius was determined
[09:13 --> 09:17] to make it to Spain so when he recovered he set out with a small cadre of friends
[09:17 --> 09:23] Agrippa included to join Caesar at the front. But if he hoped to get his first taste of
[09:23 --> 09:28] battle he was too late. By the time he reached Spain the war was already over. But
[09:28 --> 09:32] it was not a total loss. Caesar had Octavius stay with him in his tent and when the
[09:32 --> 09:36] legions packed up and headed back to Rome Octavius spent most of the journey in his
[09:36 --> 09:41] uncle's carriage picking the brain and having his brain picked by the great general.
[09:41 --> 09:45] And despite his late arrival he earned the respect of Caesar for having set out
[09:45 --> 09:49] on his journey before knowing the outcome of the war unlike the endless stream of
[09:49 --> 09:54] politicians who waited to find out who won before pouring out of Rome to find Caesar
[09:54 --> 09:59] and pay their respects. Octavius though was eventually dislodged from his prime
[09:59 --> 10:05] seat alongside Caesar when Mark Antony joined the caravan in Gaul. Octavius found himself in the
[10:05 --> 10:10] next carriage back seated alongside Decimus Brutus one of Marcus Brutus's cousins
[10:10 --> 10:15] and a longtime supporter of Caesar who would soon join the liberator conspiracy
[10:15 --> 10:19] and then play a central role in the early stages of the post-Ides of March civil wars
[10:19 --> 10:25] between the senate Octavius and the man who had just taken Octavius's spot in Caesar's carriage
[10:25 --> 10:31] Mark Antony. At some point during the journey home from Spain Caesar made up his mind about
[10:31 --> 10:36] Octavius and when they returned to Rome one of the first things he did was rewrite his will
[10:36 --> 10:41] officially declaring that in the event of his death Octavius was to be posthumously adopted
[10:41 --> 10:47] and put in charge of the family and fortune of the Julii. As an ironic historical footnote
[10:47 --> 10:52] the will also stipulated that Octavius was dead or refused the inheritance then everything
[10:52 --> 10:59] should go to Marcus Brutus the man Caesar had always loved and treated as his son et tu Brute?
[11:01 --> 11:05] To prepare Octavius for a life at the forefront of war politics and empire
[11:05 --> 11:10] Caesar introduced his new heir not that anyone Octavius included knew that Caesar
[11:10 --> 11:14] had rewritten his will at this point to the life of an all-powerful official.
[11:15 --> 11:20] The young man acted as a sort of administrative assistant serving as an intermediary between
[11:20 --> 11:25] the hordes of men who wanted five minutes just five minutes with Caesar and the man himself who
[11:25 --> 11:30] did not physically have time for them all. Octavius learned quickly how politics really
[11:30 --> 11:35] worked what was important what could be left for another day who should be flattered and
[11:35 --> 11:40] who could safely be ignored. After this crash course in practical administration
[11:40 --> 11:45] Caesar arranged for Octavius to complete his education in Apollonia where he would learn
[11:45 --> 11:49] oratory from the Greek masters and soldiering from the Macedonian legions.
[11:49 --> 11:54] Then in a few months when Rome launched its invasion of Parthia Octavius would serve
[11:54 --> 12:00] alongside Caesar and learn his final most valuable lessons how to run an army how to win
[12:00 --> 12:06] a war. But of course Octavius would never learn those final lessons from his uncle.
[12:07 --> 12:13] Word came from his mother in a letter dated March 15th 44 BC that Caesar was dead. Even
[12:13 --> 12:18] though she did not yet know the content of Caesar's will simply by virtue of being a male
[12:18 --> 12:24] relative of the murdered dictator Adia knew that her son was in danger. She implored Octavius to
[12:24 --> 12:28] return to Rome but avoid getting entangled in the public fallout of the assassination.
[12:29 --> 12:33] This request directly contradicted the advice Octavius received from his friends and mentors
[12:33 --> 12:39] in Apollonia who encouraged him to immediately take command of the five legions in Macedonia
[12:39 --> 12:44] March on Rome and avenge his uncle. While making no commitment to a private life as his mother
[12:44 --> 12:50] wished Octavius rejected the notion that he could or should lead 25,000 men in an illegal
[12:50 --> 12:55] invasion of Italy. He had never even witnessed a battle let alone fought in one and at this
[12:55 --> 12:59] point he had very real doubts about whether or not he was cut out to be a general.
[13:00 --> 13:05] So he split the difference and decided to travel back to Italy with a small company of allies
[13:05 --> 13:08] and figure out what his role would be in this new post-Caesar world.
[13:09 --> 13:13] He arrived in Brundisium and carefully approached the legions that had been mustered there
[13:13 --> 13:19] for the now canceled Parthian campaign. He found himself well received by the soldiers
[13:19 --> 13:24] and in no immediate danger from the anti-Caesar faction. Apparently back in Rome Antony had
[13:24 --> 13:29] delivered a funeral oration in the forum while Caesar lay in state and had whipped the masses
[13:29 --> 13:35] into an anti-liberator frenzy. He told them that Caesar had always held the people at the
[13:35 --> 13:39] according to his recently opened will the bulk of his property would be given to the citizens
[13:39 --> 13:44] of Rome. Then he brought out Caesar's bloodstained toga and held it for all to see
[13:44 --> 13:51] pointing to each stab hole in the fabric and naming the assassin here Cassius here Brundis.
[13:52 --> 13:56] The inflamed masses rioted looting the shopping pavilions and building a massive
[13:56 --> 14:01] funeral pyre for the body of Caesar. Then they turned on the liberators who were forced
[14:01 --> 14:07] to flee the city while the angry mobs overran their homes. Of course Octavius soon learned
[14:07 --> 14:12] that Antony's speech had been full of exaggerated showmanship. The bulk of the Caesar estate had
[14:12 --> 14:17] not been left to the citizens of Rome it had been left to him. Though the estate was not
[14:17 --> 14:23] technically left to Gaius Octavius it was instead left to Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus
[14:23 --> 14:29] Caesar's posthumously adopted son. What role would Octavius have in the new post-Caesar
[14:29 --> 14:32] world? How about one right smack dab in the middle of everything?
[14:34 --> 14:38] His mother begged him to refuse the adoption and inheritance. She understood perfectly well
[14:38 --> 14:42] what it meant to be Caesar's sole heir. What would be expected of him and what enemies he
[14:42 --> 14:48] would immediately earn. If he took Caesar's name in all likelihood he would share his uncle's
[14:48 --> 14:54] fate. But weak and fragile Octavius revealed some of the steel lurking in his heart and
[14:54 --> 15:00] rejected this advice. No he would become Gaius Julius Caesar avenge his late father
[15:00 --> 15:06] and guarantee the dictator's legacy. At this point Octavius apparently dropped his
[15:06 --> 15:11] old name altogether and henceforth went by simply Gaius Julius Caesar the name
[15:11 --> 15:15] that would rouse the passion and loyalty of his newly inherited allies. His old
[15:15 --> 15:20] name Octavius amended to Octavianus to denote that he had been adopted out of
[15:20 --> 15:24] his biological family was still officially attached to his identity but in practice
[15:24 --> 15:30] it disappeared. However historians label the new Gaius Julius Caesar Octavian through
[15:30 --> 15:36] this period simply to avoid confusing him with his dead uncle. So just a recap before
[15:36 --> 15:41] the adoption we call him Octavius. After the adoption but before he wins the civil
[15:41 --> 15:46] war we call him Octavian. After the triumph over Marc Antony we call him Augustus a
[15:47 --> 15:52] title conferred on him by the Senate in 27 BC. His friends however called him Gaius
[15:52 --> 15:58] while everyone else called him Julius Caesar. Got that? Good. Octavian was hailed
[15:58 --> 16:03] by Caesar's legions in Brindisium as a rightful new leader much to the chagrin
[16:03 --> 16:07] of Antony. But it was not just the name of Caesar that drew the legions to
[16:07 --> 16:12] support Octavian so readily. Having run the assassins out of town Antony's
[16:12 --> 16:16] posture suddenly became conciliatory. He met with the Senate and appeared to be
[16:16 --> 16:21] arranging a truce amnesty for the liberators in exchange for the Senate's promise not
[16:21 --> 16:25] to cancel any of Caesar's reforms or appointments. To the men of Caesar's
[16:25 --> 16:29] legions though this was nothing less than a betrayal. They didn't care about
[16:29 --> 16:33] avoiding a new civil war or the greater good of the state or Antony's personal
[16:33 --> 16:39] ambition. They wanted revenge. Their honor demanded it. Antony's honor ought
[16:39 --> 16:42] to have demanded it too. To see him meeting with the Senate and talking
[16:42 --> 16:46] about the compromise was an outrage that Octavian immediately capitalized on.
[16:48 --> 16:51] The young Caesar made for the capital and blowing up his mother's dream of a
[16:51 --> 16:56] quiet safe private life for her son set about publicly destabilizing the
[16:56 --> 17:00] shaky truce in Rome. Even at this early stage of the game it was obvious
[17:00 --> 17:04] that Octavian's ambitions were lofty and that he just maybe had the
[17:04 --> 17:08] talent to pull it all off. But he was young and needed time to
[17:08 --> 17:12] consolidate his position. He did not need any grand alliances leaving him
[17:12 --> 17:16] isolated the odd man out in what was shaping up to be a deadly game of
[17:16 --> 17:20] political musical chairs. So he riled up Caesar's veterans turning
[17:20 --> 17:24] them against Antony and promising to do what the waffling consul would not
[17:24 --> 17:29] avenge Caesar's death. The campaign against Antony was designed to either
[17:29 --> 17:32] alienate him from Caesar's old legions and thus deny him his most
[17:32 --> 17:36] important power base or force him to abandon his possible
[17:36 --> 17:39] alliance with the Senate in favor of a more radical position to
[17:39 --> 17:44] the troops. Antony predictably chose the latter. He knew he was nothing without
[17:44 --> 17:48] the support of Caesar's legions. So he broke off talks with the Senate
[17:48 --> 17:52] and embraced far more extreme positions. But his rage at the upstart
[17:52 --> 17:55] Octavian knew no bounds and throughout the next few months while the two
[17:55 --> 17:59] shared the spotlight in Rome, Antony took every opportunity to
[17:59 --> 18:03] ignore and demean the young man going so far as to withhold Octavian's
[18:03 --> 18:06] rightful inheritance and stall the official adoption
[18:06 --> 18:10] proceedings. But whatever personal slights were inflicted on him,
[18:10 --> 18:12] Octavian was satisfied with having divorced Antony from the Senate.
[18:15 --> 18:18] As a part of Antony's political shift, he exchanged the offer of
[18:18 --> 18:22] clemency for the liberators with forced exile. He pushed through
[18:22 --> 18:25] obscure foreign appointments for a lot of them, forcing them out of
[18:25 --> 18:28] Italy so they would not get in the way of the Caesarians as they
[18:28 --> 18:31] reentrenched. He also forced through a Cisalpine
[18:31 --> 18:35] Gaul proconsular appointment for himself to take effect as soon as he
[18:35 --> 18:38] left office. This meant cutting short the term of the current
[18:38 --> 18:42] governor, Decimus Brutus, who was not likely to give up his position
[18:42 --> 18:46] without a fight. One of the liberators, maintaining his strategic
[18:46 --> 18:49] placement at the head of an army just north of Rome, was of the
[18:49 --> 18:52] utmost importance for the remaining Republicans. And Antony relished
[18:52 --> 18:55] the opportunity not only to put himself in that all-important
[18:55 --> 18:59] province, but to remove an obvious threat at the same time,
[18:59 --> 19:02] hopefully regaining the trust of Caesar's legions by declaring
[19:02 --> 19:05] war on one of the dictator's assassins along the way.
[19:06 --> 19:09] Antony called in five legions stationed in Macedonia and ordered
[19:09 --> 19:11] them to cross the Adriatic and meet him in Brudicium.
[19:12 --> 19:15] When his term as consul ended, he would march them north and force
[19:15 --> 19:19] Brutus to capitulate. But as autumn gave way to winter,
[19:20 --> 19:24] Antony's position began to deteriorate. In September of 44 BC,
[19:24 --> 19:28] in retaliation for turning against the Senate, Cicero aimed his
[19:28 --> 19:32] considerable rhetorical artillery directly at the consul and
[19:32 --> 19:36] opened fire. Using as a model the attacks on Philip II,
[19:36 --> 19:40] Alexander the Great's father, by the Greek order Demosthenes,
[19:40 --> 19:42] Cicero delivered a series of scathing orations,
[19:43 --> 19:46] collectively known as the Philippics, denouncing Antony. He
[19:46 --> 19:49] asked the Senate to declare the dangerous consul an enemy
[19:49 --> 19:52] of the state, while going out of his way to heat praise on
[19:52 --> 19:55] Octavian, who he had clearly determined was the lesser of
[19:55 --> 19:59] the two Caesarian evils. Cicero succeeded in turning public
[19:59 --> 20:02] opinion against Antony, but the orations were probably the
[20:02 --> 20:06] final nail in his coffin. In a few months, when a
[20:06 --> 20:09] reconciled Antony and Octavian meet to discuss the
[20:09 --> 20:12] fate of their enemies, Antony will be uncompromising on the
[20:12 --> 20:16] question of Cicero. The old windbag was dead, dead,
[20:16 --> 20:21] dead, dead. Even worse for Antony, though, word came in
[20:21 --> 20:24] November that two of the five Macedonian legions were
[20:24 --> 20:28] effecting to Octavian's banner. The young man was lucky to have
[20:28 --> 20:30] spent the months leading up to Caesar's assassination in
[20:30 --> 20:33] Greece, and had become quite popular with the troops in
[20:33 --> 20:36] Macedonia. For the first time, it wasn't just the name of
[20:36 --> 20:39] Caesar, but the personal magnetism of Octavian himself
[20:39 --> 20:43] that was having an effect on the balance of power. With
[20:43 --> 20:46] the army going to Octavian and Cicero lining up the
[20:46 --> 20:48] Senate to support the young Caesar and the people
[20:48 --> 20:52] turning against him, Antony knew he had to act fast. Before
[20:52 --> 20:55] his term as consul ended, he collected the three legions
[20:55 --> 20:58] still loyal to him, and marched for Cisalpine Gaul. He
[20:58 --> 21:01] would dislodge the assassin Brutus and hold the rich and
[21:01 --> 21:04] strategically important province for himself. Plus,
[21:05 --> 21:07] no one had yet taken into account the tens of
[21:07 --> 21:10] thousands of troops stationed in Gaul and Spain. The
[21:10 --> 21:13] officers in charge of the legions of Western Europe were
[21:13 --> 21:15] his personal friends and the soldiers his longtime
[21:15 --> 21:18] comrades. Antony was confident that they would
[21:18 --> 21:21] attack him over the growing Octavian-Senatorial alliance.
[21:22 --> 21:25] At the end of 44 BC, he marched out of Rome bloodied,
[21:25 --> 21:26] but not beaten.
[21:29 --> 21:32] Next week, Antony will bottle up the governor of Cisalpine
[21:32 --> 21:34] Gaul, Decimus Brutus, and nearly starve him into
[21:34 --> 21:38] submission. But the new consuls for the year 43 BC
[21:38 --> 21:40] will raise armies and march to Brutus' relief, having
[21:40 --> 21:43] already followed Cicero's advice by declaring Antony an
[21:43 --> 21:47] enemy of the state. Marching with them, headed
[21:47 --> 21:49] towards his first battle, will be the newly appointed
[21:49 --> 21:53] procreator Octavian. Though for the briefest of moments,
[21:53 --> 21:55] Antony and Octavian will find themselves on opposite
[21:55 --> 21:58] sides, they will soon come into an agreement, forming
[21:58 --> 22:01] an alliance along with Caesar's old consular colleague
[22:01 --> 22:04] Lepidus. And while the first triumvirate had been a
[22:04 --> 22:07] powerful political force, it had nothing on the brutal
[22:07 --> 22:10] ruthlessness of this new alliance, the second triumvirate.

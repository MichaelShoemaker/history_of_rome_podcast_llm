[00:00 --> 00:15] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 147, Capitulation.
[00:15 --> 00:19] Last week, we left off with the Eastern Legions in a bit of a scrape.
[00:19 --> 00:24] The Emperor Julian was dead, he had not named a successor, and they were surrounded on all
[00:24 --> 00:28] sides by a hostile, sassanid army.
[00:28 --> 00:31] Any one of those things taken alone would have been pretty rotten.
[00:31 --> 00:39] But taken together, well, let's break out the popcorn and see what happens next.
[00:39 --> 00:43] After news of Julian's death got out, the senior officers of the army got together and
[00:43 --> 00:47] tried to figure out what the hell they were going to do next.
[00:47 --> 00:53] Naturally, the first order of business was figuring out who was in charge.
[00:53 --> 00:58] After all, a good chain of command can't just peter out into a mud puddle of cavalry
[00:58 --> 01:00] officers and supply chiefs.
[01:00 --> 01:04] Someone's got to be the eye in the pyramid.
[01:04 --> 01:08] With no imperial relatives around to make the choice easy on them, the officers turned
[01:08 --> 01:15] to the most obvious non-royal candidate, the senior praetorian prefect, Saturninus Secundus
[01:15 --> 01:17] Salutius.
[01:17 --> 01:22] The prefect was universally respected, and from the moment Julian had been named Caesar,
[01:22 --> 01:28] Salutius had been one of the emperor's closest and most influential advisors.
[01:28 --> 01:32] He had been so trusted, in fact, that when Julian had formed the commission to oversee
[01:32 --> 01:40] the post-Constantius purge of the imperial court, Salutius had been its chairman.
[01:40 --> 01:43] Elevated to the rank praetorian prefect of the east after the commission wrapped up its
[01:43 --> 01:49] business, Salutius was the highest ranking official in the tent after Julian died.
[01:49 --> 01:54] So the senior officers of the army tried to make him emperor.
[01:54 --> 01:59] But Salutius begged off, pleading that he was too old and too sick for such an exhausting
[01:59 --> 02:00] job.
[02:00 --> 02:07] Also, man, is now really the best time to become emperor?
[02:07 --> 02:12] So the officers went back to the drawing board and came up with a surprising new candidate,
[02:12 --> 02:17] a man who at the very least would not be able to cite Arthritis as an excuse to get out
[02:17 --> 02:25] of the promotion, captain of the imperial bodyguard, Flavius Jovianus.
[02:25 --> 02:31] The choice of Jovian was surprising not just because he was only 31 years old, but also
[02:31 --> 02:33] because he was a relative unknown.
[02:33 --> 02:39] That is, he was not some high official or long-serving officer with a lifetime of experience
[02:39 --> 02:42] under his belt and friends in all corners of the empire.
[02:43 --> 02:48] Plus, while he was a fine officer, he had likely risen as high as he had, as fast as
[02:48 --> 02:54] he had, not because of merit, but because his father had served for years in that same
[02:54 --> 02:57] post.
[02:57 --> 03:01] So though his sudden elevation to the purple is surprising, I reckon that Jovian got the
[03:01 --> 03:04] call for two main reasons.
[03:04 --> 03:09] First, because there were enough internal rivalries between the officers that, after
[03:10 --> 03:14] any unanimous choice was going to have to be a lesser candidate because all the better
[03:14 --> 03:18] candidates had enemies in the room.
[03:18 --> 03:25] And second, again, man, is now really the best time to become emperor?
[03:25 --> 03:30] Ammionus Marcellinus reports that Jovian was such an unexpected choice that when the soldiers
[03:30 --> 03:35] cheered his elevation, it is possible that they completely misunderstood who they were
[03:35 --> 03:36] cheering.
[03:36 --> 03:40] That some thought they were hailing a high notary named Jovianus, while others thought
[03:40 --> 03:45] they were cheering a recovered Julian.
[03:45 --> 03:52] But despite coming out of nowhere, Jovian was not exactly coming out of nowhere.
[03:52 --> 03:57] He was born around 331 in Illyria, making him roughly the same age as Julian, and as
[03:57 --> 04:02] I mentioned, he was the son of a highly regarded officer who had risen to become captain of
[04:03 --> 04:06] Second's personal bodyguard.
[04:06 --> 04:11] Jovian was also, coincidentally enough, the son-in-law of the commander of the Sirmium
[04:11 --> 04:18] garrison who Julian had kidnapped just prior to taking the city in mid-361.
[04:18 --> 04:23] There are two interesting things to note about Jovian's rise in the ranks that speak to
[04:23 --> 04:25] Julian's character.
[04:25 --> 04:30] First, Julian was not necessarily one to hold a family grudge.
[04:30 --> 04:36] Both Jovian's father and father-in-law had been loyal to Constantius II, which you would
[04:36 --> 04:40] think would be the sort of thing that would actually preclude Jovian from being promoted
[04:40 --> 04:45] to such a key position, but apparently it was not.
[04:45 --> 04:52] Second, Jovian was openly Christian, which contradicts any notion that Julian was an
[04:52 --> 04:54] anti-Christian extremist.
[04:54 --> 05:00] He was anti-Christian, sure, but a good officer was a good officer, and good officers were
[05:00 --> 05:03] in short supply.
[05:03 --> 05:08] The presence in the army of Valentinian, who we will get to in a moment, further speaks
[05:08 --> 05:14] to the surprisingly limited extent of Julian's religious intolerance, which is to say that
[05:14 --> 05:22] when push came to shove for Julian, talent often trumped religion.
[05:22 --> 05:27] Before I get off this point, I should note also, though, that the same was true for Constantine
[05:27 --> 05:28] and his sons.
[05:29 --> 05:34] Yes, they were Christian and promoted Christianity and tried to push paganism to the fringes,
[05:34 --> 05:39] but during the period between the Milvian Bridge and the revolt of Julian, polytheist
[05:39 --> 05:45] officers and polytheist officials continued to occupy key positions in the military and
[05:45 --> 05:47] in the government.
[05:47 --> 05:53] The emperors were pragmatic men ruling in difficult times, and talent was not just something
[05:53 --> 06:02] you could discard, even if there was a larger religious battle to fight.
[06:02 --> 06:08] In terms of the sheer ugliness of the situation an emperor walked into upon donning the purple,
[06:08 --> 06:14] there were few situations uglier than the one Jovian walked into.
[06:14 --> 06:19] Probably only the ascension of Gallus, who came to power after the disaster at Abertus,
[06:19 --> 06:25] holds Jovian's ascension in terms of its terrible no-goodness.
[06:25 --> 06:31] In both cases, an emperor was dead at the enemy's hand, that enemy was still at hand,
[06:31 --> 06:36] and the Roman army was mentally and physically broken.
[06:36 --> 06:42] Which is why only Gallus could probably appreciate what Jovian did next.
[06:42 --> 06:47] Certainly none of Jovian's contemporaries demonstrated any appreciation for it at all.
[06:47 --> 06:53] It's easy to demand vigor and resiliency, and if that fails, noble self-sacrifice, when
[06:53 --> 06:57] you're safely tucked thousands of miles away at the imperial capital.
[06:57 --> 07:05] Much harder when you're actually standing there, plausibly facing total annihilation.
[07:05 --> 07:10] The new emperor at first attempted to continue the retreat towards Armenia, but the loss
[07:10 --> 07:16] of Julian had destroyed morale, so he did what he no doubt felt he had to do.
[07:16 --> 07:24] He sent envoys to Shapur, and asked what the price would be for safe passage home.
[07:24 --> 07:29] Shapur was delighted by this turn of events, and replied that the terms would be simple.
[07:29 --> 07:35] Give back all the territory ceded to Galerius by the Treaty of Nispis, exactly what the
[07:35 --> 07:41] Sassanid king had demanded of Constantius back in 357.
[07:41 --> 07:45] This meant the Romans would have to evacuate all the fortress cities that had acted as
[07:45 --> 07:49] their forward line of defense, and pull out of all the territory they occupied on the
[07:49 --> 07:51] far side of the Tigris.
[07:51 --> 07:57] The one added term Shapur tacked on was a guarantee of Armenian neutrality in all future
[07:57 --> 08:02] conflicts between the two empires.
[08:02 --> 08:07] The terms were harsh, and essentially amounted to total capitulation for the Romans, but
[08:07 --> 08:10] Jovian had little choice.
[08:10 --> 08:16] For him, the deal boiled down to capitulate with your army left intact, or capitulate
[08:16 --> 08:18] after it has been destroyed.
[08:18 --> 08:23] Sure, in the latter case maybe you get to go out fighting, but was that really in the
[08:23 --> 08:26] best interests of the empire long term?
[08:26 --> 08:33] To lose its whole eastern army in battle just for the sheer stubborn glory of it all?
[08:34 --> 08:40] Jovian, probably glad Shapur wasn't asking for more, accepted the terms.
[08:40 --> 08:45] The Romans were granted safe passage back to Syria.
[08:45 --> 08:50] Julian had gone out looking for victory for victory's sake, and the army instead returned
[08:50 --> 08:56] with nothing to show for it, but defeat for the sake of survival.
[08:56 --> 09:03] Now, I would be remiss if I did not point out that there is another way to look at the
[09:03 --> 09:05] Roman surrender.
[09:05 --> 09:11] For example, Ammianus Marcellinus states that Jovian misunderstood the tactical realities
[09:11 --> 09:13] of the situation.
[09:13 --> 09:18] That the new emperor was mistaken in his belief that the cause was hopeless, because Shapur
[09:18 --> 09:22] was actually much weaker than he appeared.
[09:22 --> 09:25] And it is worth asking a few questions.
[09:25 --> 09:30] If the cause was so hopeless, why hadn't the Sassanids crushed the Romans yet?
[09:30 --> 09:35] If the cause was so hopeless, why had Shapur asked only for withdrawal from the land beyond
[09:35 --> 09:36] the Tigris?
[09:36 --> 09:39] Why not demand all of Mesopotamia?
[09:39 --> 09:45] Why not demand the Roman army lay down its arms before they headed home?
[09:45 --> 09:50] The answers to these questions no doubt lie in Shapur's own evaluation of the situation,
[09:50 --> 09:54] which likely jibes with Marcellinus' assessment.
[09:54 --> 09:58] That the Romans were run down, but they weren't beaten yet.
[09:58 --> 10:02] But it was best not to risk asking the Romans for too much, because if they decided they
[10:02 --> 10:10] had to fight on, well, this isn't exactly a case of the ant begging the foot for mercy.
[10:10 --> 10:15] Shapur clearly did not think he held the lives of the Romans in the palm of his hand, otherwise
[10:15 --> 10:18] the terms would have been even harsher.
[10:18 --> 10:25] Indeed, if Jovian had decided to keep on fighting, it is very possible that the fortunes of war
[10:25 --> 10:30] could have turned this all from a Roman debacle into a Roman victory, a fact the Sassanid
[10:30 --> 10:34] king must have been acutely aware of.
[10:34 --> 10:40] So when the emperor came calling, Shapur jumped at the chance to end this thing on favorable
[10:40 --> 10:41] terms.
[10:41 --> 10:46] Remember, he had never wanted this war in the first place, because he did not think
[10:46 --> 10:54] he was strong enough to beat the Romans without it costing him big time.
[10:54 --> 10:59] All that said, however, a strategy that pins its hopes on the fortunes of war suddenly
[10:59 --> 11:04] turning your way risks an awful lot.
[11:04 --> 11:10] In this case, it meant risking the safety of the entire eastern empire.
[11:10 --> 11:15] If the expeditionary army was destroyed, then there would be nothing to stop Shapur from
[11:15 --> 11:20] sacking Antioch, and maybe even from sacking Alexandria.
[11:20 --> 11:22] It was just that simple.
[11:22 --> 11:27] At a minimum, any further fighting would just mean more dead Roman soldiers.
[11:27 --> 11:33] Not dead for any purpose, but dead because the invasion had been a bad idea, poorly executed,
[11:33 --> 11:37] and no one wanted to admit it.
[11:37 --> 11:43] Sometimes you just have to grit your teeth, tip your cap, and go home.
[11:43 --> 11:44] And what was the cost?
[11:44 --> 11:46] Some land beyond the Tigris?
[11:46 --> 11:48] No one was ceding Syria.
[11:48 --> 11:51] No one was handing over Egypt.
[11:51 --> 11:56] Everyone was accepting mild defeat, rather than risk appalling defeat.
[11:56 --> 11:58] Was it the optimum outcome?
[11:58 --> 12:00] Of course not.
[12:00 --> 12:05] Especially when you factor in that the surrender, of course, emboldened Shapur and left later
[12:05 --> 12:11] Romans hungry for revenge, which virtually guaranteed continued strife along the eastern
[12:11 --> 12:14] frontier for another generation.
[12:14 --> 12:20] And as you may or may not know, that strife will one day prove so distracting that the
[12:20 --> 12:25] issue of what to do about the horde of Goths that just showed up on the Danube asking for
[12:25 --> 12:28] asylum will be badly mishandled.
[12:28 --> 12:32] And I mean, badly mishandled.
[12:32 --> 12:33] Who knows?
[12:33 --> 12:37] Maybe a mutually destructive fight in the desert would have led to an exhausted peace
[12:37 --> 12:44] in the east that would have left the Romans free to deal with the incoming Goths responsibly.
[12:44 --> 12:47] But now I'm just kind of wandering off topic.
[12:47 --> 12:49] Jovian made the deal.
[12:49 --> 12:56] The Roman army headed home intact.
[12:56 --> 13:01] When Jovian and his exhausted men arrived back in Roman territory, the reaction to his
[13:01 --> 13:05] peace deal was immediate and negative.
[13:05 --> 13:09] The ruling narrative quickly became that Jovian was a coward who had sold out the empire to
[13:09 --> 13:12] save his own skin.
[13:12 --> 13:17] In an age when military victory and political legitimacy were one in the same, just ask
[13:17 --> 13:24] Julian, Jovian had committed the unforgivable sin of surrender.
[13:24 --> 13:28] It would have been interesting to see just how long Jovian would have been able to stay
[13:28 --> 13:33] in power given this albatross hanging around his neck.
[13:33 --> 13:38] We'll never know, of course, because, well, we'll get to that in a second.
[13:38 --> 13:44] But it is hard to imagine too much time passing before Jovian faced either a palace coup or
[13:44 --> 13:49] a military revolt.
[13:49 --> 13:53] By all accounts, the emperor was acutely aware of his unpopularity.
[13:53 --> 13:59] But before heading to Constantinople, he lingered in Antioch and began the process of returning
[13:59 --> 14:02] the empire to Christianity.
[14:02 --> 14:06] The fact that he was personally a Christian had to have played a major role in his subsequent
[14:06 --> 14:08] edicts.
[14:08 --> 14:12] But it's easy to imagine the new emperor also believed he was laying the foundations
[14:12 --> 14:14] for his own base of power.
[14:14 --> 14:18] Reinstate the Christians, get the support of the Christians.
[14:18 --> 14:22] Isn't that how these things work?
[14:22 --> 14:28] To this end, Julian unrolled most of the restrictions on Christian practices and revived most of
[14:28 --> 14:31] the restrictions on pagan practices.
[14:31 --> 14:39] The empire would never again return to its polytheistic roots.
[14:39 --> 14:43] In November of 363, Jovian felt that things were settled enough in the east that he could
[14:43 --> 14:50] afford to head to Constantinople and face his political unpopularity head on.
[14:50 --> 14:55] He knew that he was likely walking into a viper's nest of backstabbers, because, after
[14:55 --> 14:59] all, in addition to being the man who had surrendered the eastern legions, he wasn't
[14:59 --> 15:06] even a member of the Constantinian dynasty, so who did he think he was anyway?
[15:06 --> 15:10] It was going to be a tough sell, but Jovian was a tough guy and ready to do what he had
[15:10 --> 15:17] to do to secure the throne for years to come, except, yeah, it's not going to happen.
[15:17 --> 15:23] In February of 364, Jovian was heading down the home stretch in between Ancyra and Nicaea
[15:23 --> 15:26] when he suddenly died.
[15:26 --> 15:33] Some sources point to carbon monoxide poisoning, while others point to poison mushrooms.
[15:33 --> 15:38] A few later sources take it on faith that the emperor was assassinated, but most modern
[15:38 --> 15:42] scholars seem to come down squarely on the side of a freak accident.
[15:42 --> 15:48] I, for one, am under the impression that Livia did it.
[15:48 --> 15:53] Whatever or whoever it was that killed Jovian, he was 32 years old when he died and had ruled
[15:53 --> 15:59] the empire for just eight months.
[15:59 --> 16:04] I hate to say this because I'm fairly sympathetic to Jovian, but I think his death was a blessing
[16:04 --> 16:05] for Rome.
[16:05 --> 16:11] I really don't see how the empire survives the next few years or even the next few months
[16:11 --> 16:15] without some kind of disastrous civil war.
[16:15 --> 16:19] There had already been riots in Milan when Julian's death was announced, riots that
[16:19 --> 16:23] wound up killing Jovian's father-in-law, by the way, who had been the one to read the
[16:23 --> 16:26] announcement.
[16:26 --> 16:28] Julian was a political newcomer.
[16:28 --> 16:33] He had no connection to the previous dynasty, and he had just surrendered to the Sassanids.
[16:33 --> 16:38] You take these three things together and you get big red flashing lights going off in the
[16:38 --> 16:44] head of every ambitious general and prefect in the empire.
[16:44 --> 16:48] Though Rome would still have to deal with the brief revolt of Julian's maternal cousin
[16:48 --> 16:54] Procopius, I don't think that that even touches the kind of civil discord that probably would
[16:54 --> 16:57] have broken out had Julian lived.
[16:57 --> 17:02] That's just speculation on my part, but I think the combination of Valentinian and Valens
[17:02 --> 17:12] offered a much stronger imperial hand than Jovian would have ever been able to provide.
[17:12 --> 17:15] Which brings us to Valentinian and Valens.
[17:15 --> 17:18] Who are Valentinian and Valens, you ask?
[17:18 --> 17:20] Well, I'll tell you.
[17:20 --> 17:25] The former was a highly regarded officer who was in the right place at the right time,
[17:25 --> 17:30] and the latter was that guy's brother.
[17:30 --> 17:36] Flavius Valentinianus had been born in 321 in Pannonia, and was the son of an important
[17:36 --> 17:39] general named Gracianus.
[17:39 --> 17:44] Gracianus had spent most of his career in the west, and he reached the uppermost rungs
[17:44 --> 17:48] of the chain of command during the reign of Constans.
[17:48 --> 17:53] Young Valentinian joined the army just after Constans took control of all the western provinces
[17:53 --> 18:01] in 340, and he followed his father to postings first in North Africa, and then in Britain.
[18:01 --> 18:06] After Gracianus presciently retired just before the fall of Constans, we don't know where
[18:06 --> 18:11] exactly Valentinian went next, but it was almost certainly somewhere along the Rhine
[18:11 --> 18:16] or Danube frontier.
[18:16 --> 18:22] The confusion about who was doing what when continues during the period of Magnentius's
[18:22 --> 18:24] revolt.
[18:24 --> 18:30] No sources speak to what, if any role Valentinian played in the conflict, but we do know that
[18:30 --> 18:37] following his victory, Constantius II confiscated the estates of Gracianus, hinting that the
[18:37 --> 18:43] retired general may have been providing support for the usurping general, which was not out
[18:43 --> 18:50] of the question since the two old soldiers were both veterans of the western legions.
[18:50 --> 18:54] If Valentinian joined his father's presumed support for Magnentius, it cannot have been
[18:54 --> 19:01] too staunch because the rising officer next appears in Gaul attached to Julian's army,
[19:01 --> 19:09] which is not exactly the sort of promotion you'd expect for a blood enemy of the dynasty.
[19:09 --> 19:14] It was in Gaul that Valentinian really began to make a name for himself.
[19:14 --> 19:20] He served with distinction as a cavalry officer, almost certainly fought at the Battle of Strausburg,
[19:20 --> 19:26] and generally endeared himself to superiors and subordinates alike.
[19:26 --> 19:30] The senior officers liked him because he got the job done, and the grunts liked him because
[19:30 --> 19:37] of his easy-going disposition, a disposition which is kind of hard to imagine given Valentinian's
[19:37 --> 19:42] ultimate cause of death.
[19:42 --> 19:48] In the winter of 359-360, Valentinian was promoted to the eastern legions, as Constantius
[19:48 --> 19:53] prepared for war against the Sassanids, and he was likely already in Antioch by the time
[19:53 --> 19:58] Julian revolted in January of 360.
[19:58 --> 20:02] For Valentinian, the upshot of this imperial conflict was that he was immediately dismissed
[20:02 --> 20:08] from service by Constantius, who was concerned that Valentinian's close ties to Julian would
[20:08 --> 20:13] make him a potential snake in the grass.
[20:13 --> 20:17] As with the revolt of Magnentius, we don't know what Valentinian thought about Julian's
[20:17 --> 20:23] uprising, but it's possible Constantius was being overly paranoid about the whole thing,
[20:23 --> 20:28] because after Julian became sole emperor, Valentinian was forced to remain in semi-exile
[20:28 --> 20:31] in Egypt.
[20:31 --> 20:36] As a Christian, in a time when that was suddenly a bad thing again, Valentinian's future was
[20:36 --> 20:38] very much in doubt.
[20:38 --> 20:44] However, as Julian was building up his war machine to go invade Persia, he recalled Valentinian
[20:44 --> 20:46] to service.
[20:46 --> 20:52] Like I said, good officers are good officers, whatever they believe, and Valentinian was
[20:52 --> 20:57] a good officer.
[20:57 --> 21:01] His reward for being such a good officer was that he got to witness firsthand the utter
[21:01 --> 21:07] meltdown of the eastern invasion, Julian's subsequent death, and the Roman army's humiliating
[21:07 --> 21:10] withdrawal back to Syria.
[21:10 --> 21:15] When they reached Antioch though, Valentinian received one of the most fortuitous promotions
[21:15 --> 21:18] in history.
[21:18 --> 21:22] As Jovian worked through the aftermath of the failed invasion and tried to lay the groundwork
[21:22 --> 21:30] for his own imperial rule, he sent Valentinian to Ancyra to command a key infantry division.
[21:30 --> 21:35] Which meant that when Jovian passed through a few months later, and then suddenly died
[21:35 --> 21:41] a few miles down the road, well, good Valentinian was right there, wasn't he?
[21:41 --> 21:45] I mean, literally, physically, right there.
[21:45 --> 21:49] Wasn't he?
[21:49 --> 21:53] The immediate response to Jovian's death was very similar to the immediate response
[21:53 --> 21:55] to Julian's death.
[21:55 --> 22:00] The military and political inner circle got together and tried to figure out who the next
[22:00 --> 22:03] next emperor was going to be.
[22:03 --> 22:12] Initially, two names were put forward, Equitius, a veteran officer, and Januarius, a relative
[22:12 --> 22:18] of Jovian's who was currently overseeing supply operations in Illyria.
[22:18 --> 22:23] But as the officials talked their way through the problem, Equitius was rejected because
[22:23 --> 22:28] he was a bit rough around the edges, too much soldier and not enough statesman.
[22:28 --> 22:34] Then, Januarius was rejected because there would be a frightening lag time between now
[22:34 --> 22:38] and when we can actually drape him in the purple.
[22:38 --> 22:44] No one wanted to be responsible for opening up a prolonged power vacuum.
[22:44 --> 22:50] So what they needed was an experienced officer who was educated and cultured enough to survive
[22:50 --> 22:55] as a politician, but who was also near enough at hand that we can get him in office like
[22:55 --> 22:57] right now.
[22:57 --> 23:02] And then someone mentioned Valentinian, who they had just passed a few days back.
[23:02 --> 23:07] And they all liked and respected Valentinian, and the men seemed to like and respect Valentinian,
[23:07 --> 23:13] and he's pretty well educated, and hey, I think we have our man.
[23:14 --> 23:20] A messenger was sent at once to fetch the no doubt surprised, but apparently willing,
[23:20 --> 23:28] Valentinian, and on February 26, 364 AD, he became emperor of the Roman Empire.
[23:28 --> 23:33] When he emerged to address the assembled troops, however, they greeted him more as an angry
[23:33 --> 23:37] mob than as joyful subjects.
[23:37 --> 23:41] With all the backroom picking of emperors lately, the soldiers were starting to feel
[23:41 --> 23:43] left out of the process.
[23:43 --> 23:49] But Valentinian assured them that the needs of the army would always come first, and that
[23:49 --> 23:53] they had nothing to fear from Emperor Valentinian.
[23:53 --> 23:57] After all, was he not one of them?
[23:57 --> 24:02] With the army now pretty securely on his side, Valentinian next had to shore up political
[24:02 --> 24:05] support for his new dynasty.
[24:05 --> 24:11] To this end, one of his first acts as emperor was to announce that he would be appointing
[24:11 --> 24:13] another emperor.
[24:13 --> 24:20] With the east not at all secured, and the west shaky at best, appointing a second emperor
[24:20 --> 24:24] would ensure that everyone would have the imperial authority they needed to respond
[24:24 --> 24:28] to crises when they needed it.
[24:28 --> 24:34] A few weeks later, Valentinian completed Jovian's journey and arrived in Constantinople, whereupon
[24:34 --> 24:41] he announced his choice for co-emperor, his brother Valens, the man who, as I'm sure
[24:41 --> 24:47] you already know, will one day ride out into a swarm of Goths at the disastrous Battle
[24:47 --> 24:50] of Adrianople, never to return.
[25:04 --> 25:11] .

[00:03 --> 00:07] Hello, and welcome to this post-History of Rome update.
[00:09 --> 00:13] So it's been a little over a year since the History of Rome wrapped up, and I think it's
[00:13 --> 00:14] time for an update.
[00:15 --> 00:16] So here is an update.
[00:17 --> 00:22] Initially, I was planning to start producing the next podcast sometime in mid to late 2014,
[00:23 --> 00:26] but that plan has now been chucked out the window.
[00:26 --> 00:31] About a month ago, Mrs. The History of Rome took a job in Madison, Wisconsin, and we dropped
[00:31 --> 00:32] everything and moved north.
[00:33 --> 00:35] This means that there is now a new plan.
[00:35 --> 00:39] A new plan that has me working on the next show right now.
[00:40 --> 00:44] If all goes according to the new plan, the next show will debut sometime in early September
[00:45 --> 00:46] 2013.
[00:48 --> 00:55] Also, I know that this is short notice, but tomorrow, May 31st at 6.30pm EST, I will be
[00:55 --> 00:59] doing an Ask Me Anything at Reddit, specifically the History subreddit.
[01:00 --> 01:05] There is a link posted at thehistoryofrome.typepad.com, and if someone wants to go ahead and ask me
[01:05 --> 01:08] what the next show is about, I will answer them.
[01:09 --> 01:11] Okay, so that is your update.
[01:11 --> 01:16] I will see you tomorrow on Reddit, and if not, I will see you in September.

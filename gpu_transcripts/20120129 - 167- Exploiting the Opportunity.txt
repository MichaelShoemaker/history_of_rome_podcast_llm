[00:04 --> 00:13] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 167, Exploiting the Opportunity.
[00:16 --> 00:19] 421 was a busy year for the Roman Empire.
[00:19 --> 00:24] The great general, Constantius III, had been elevated to the rank of co-Augustus in the
[00:24 --> 00:29] west, nearly launched an invasion of the east to defend his claim to the throne, and then
[00:29 --> 00:32] peeled over dead before winter set in.
[00:33 --> 00:38] His would-be opponent in a nearly missed civil war, Theodosius II, had gotten married and
[00:38 --> 00:43] then almost immediately announced that his new wife, who had changed her name to Elia
[00:43 --> 00:47] Eudoxia upon marriage, was pregnant with the heir to the eastern throne.
[00:49 --> 00:54] But as these domestic imperial squabbles and celebrations were playing out, events in the
[00:54 --> 00:56] Far East threatened to overshadow everything.
[00:57 --> 01:04] In early 421, the king of the Sassanids, a moderate, benevolent, and well-respected
[01:04 --> 01:06] leader named Yazdegerd, suddenly died.
[01:07 --> 01:13] He had ruled since late 399, and among the great political feats to his credit was the
[01:13 --> 01:17] fact that he had been the prime mover behind the peace talks with Rome that had concluded
[01:17 --> 01:20] with the signing of a treaty in 409.
[01:21 --> 01:28] Yazdegerd was succeeded by his son, Baram V, who, unfortunately, adopted a far less
[01:28 --> 01:33] conciliatory posture, and upon his ascension he immediately launched a program of persecution
[01:33 --> 01:40] against any Roman citizen or any Christian living in his kingdom as he viewed both as
[01:40 --> 01:44] potential fifth columnists preparing to fatally weaken the Sassanid empire.
[01:45 --> 01:53] This immediate adoption of anti-Roman, anti-Christian policies was unfortunate all on its own, but
[01:53 --> 01:58] it was doubly unfortunate because of who happened to be ruling the eastern Roman empire at that
[01:58 --> 01:59] exact moment.
[02:01 --> 02:07] As we touched on last week, Elia Pulcheria, who was enormously influential at this point
[02:07 --> 02:13] in her brother's reign, was a devout Nicene Christian, and her particular brand of devotion
[02:13 --> 02:18] was not limited to the admirable bits about inward piety and outward promotion of beliefs,
[02:19 --> 02:25] no, it also included the far less admirable bit about persecuting those who do not share
[02:25 --> 02:26] your beliefs.
[02:27 --> 02:32] She despised pagans, Jews, and heretics, and took active steps to make sure that they knew
[02:32 --> 02:34] exactly how she felt.
[02:35 --> 02:42] For example, construction of new synagogues was banned, and in areas where it could be
[02:42 --> 02:45] unrest, existing synagogues were torn down.
[02:46 --> 02:51] Pagans for the first time were officially barred from holding public office or serving
[02:51 --> 02:51] in the military.
[02:52 --> 02:57] Up until now, ambitious bureaucrats and soldiers had faced intense peer pressure to convert
[02:57 --> 03:03] to Christianity, and at times those who resisted were denied promotion or given crappy assignments,
[03:03 --> 03:07] but there had never been an outright ban on pagans serving the state.
[03:08 --> 03:13] Elia Pulcheria ensured that such a ban was now firmly in place.
[03:15 --> 03:20] So just at the moment when an anti-Christian king was coming to power in Persia, a fervently
[03:20 --> 03:23] pro-Christian Augusta was controlling the Eastern Empire.
[03:25 --> 03:29] When she found out that the heathen king of the Sassanids was persecuting her religious
[03:29 --> 03:33] brethren, she pressed Theodosius II to do something about it.
[03:34 --> 03:40] Theodosius responded by hinting to Baram, as Constantine had once hinted to Shapur back
[03:40 --> 03:45] in 336, that as the leader of world Christianity, the government of Constantinople would take
[03:45 --> 03:50] any and all steps necessary to protect the lives, property, and rights of Christians
[03:50 --> 03:52] wherever they may dwell.
[03:53 --> 03:59] Baram responded to this threat to his sovereignty by launching a unilateral attack on Roman-held
[03:59 --> 04:02] territory along the border between the two great empires.
[04:03 --> 04:08] Theodosius ordered his generals in Syria to return fire, and just like that, Rome and
[04:08 --> 04:10] Persia were at war again.
[04:10 --> 04:15] I do so love it when inflexible people get together like that and really just do the
[04:15 --> 04:16] right thing for everyone.
[04:18 --> 04:22] Luckily for everyone, the war did not last long.
[04:22 --> 04:27] The advancing Persian army was driven back by the Romans, who then proceeded to lay siege
[04:27 --> 04:32] to Nisbys until a reinforced Persian army arrived to relieve the city and the Romans
[04:33 --> 04:34] retreated.
[04:34 --> 04:40] Hostilities continued into 422, but by then it appears that the leadership of both empires
[04:40 --> 04:45] realized what a hopeless waste of time and resources this pointless little war was.
[04:46 --> 04:50] The land the Sassanids had typically fought for in the past had been ceded by the Romans
[04:50 --> 04:57] way back in the aftermath of Julian the Apostate's invasion, so Baram was pressing for lands
[04:57 --> 05:00] he had almost no political or cultural claim to.
[05:00 --> 05:05] The Romans meanwhile, who would have probably liked to renew their long abandoned forward
[05:05 --> 05:10] bases in Mesopotamia, were suddenly faced with a more dire threat from the north.
[05:10 --> 05:14] The Huns were once again crossing the Danube into imperial territory.
[05:16 --> 05:21] So cooler heads prevailed, and in 422 the peace treaty between Rome and Persia was renewed,
[05:21 --> 05:25] on the same terms that had existed before the recent hostilities had begun.
[05:28 --> 05:34] Luckily for Constantinople, the Huns had not regained the sort of unity Olden had been
[05:34 --> 05:39] able to forge, and this latest Hun invasion was driven back with, if not ease, then at
[05:39 --> 05:41] least not too much difficulty.
[05:42 --> 05:47] But though both the major Hun incursions into Roman territory had ultimately been turned
[05:47 --> 05:51] back, it was clear that the Huns could not be ignored.
[05:52 --> 05:57] Disunited, they were an exhausting foe who would require copious amounts of Roman blood
[05:57 --> 06:03] and treasure to keep at bay, hence the belated realization that, oh my god, we really can't
[06:03 --> 06:05] afford a war with the Sassanids.
[06:06 --> 06:06] United?
[06:07 --> 06:12] United, well, there was a very real fear in the court of Constantinople that the Romans
[06:12 --> 06:15] would not be able to turn the Huns back.
[06:17 --> 06:22] While the ministers and generals of the Eastern Empire wrestled with what to do about the
[06:22 --> 06:28] Huns, Theodosius II received a surprising letter from his cousin in Ravenna.
[06:28 --> 06:34] Not his fellow emperor Honorius, mind you, but the Western Emperor's sister, the recently
[06:34 --> 06:35] widowed Galla Placidia.
[06:37 --> 06:42] The letter said simply that she would be leaving the West and traveling to Constantinople,
[06:42 --> 06:46] where she hoped that she and her children would be welcomed with all due hospitality.
[06:48 --> 06:53] We do not have a rock-solid explanation for Galla Placidia's decision to suddenly leave
[06:53 --> 06:58] Ravenna, but clearly there had been some sort of falling out between her and her brother,
[06:59 --> 07:04] and it is sometimes suggested that Honorius had recently begun making untoward advances
[07:04 --> 07:06] on his sister, if you catch my drift.
[07:08 --> 07:13] It is further noted that this quarrel at the top of the imperial food chain was being felt
[07:13 --> 07:15] up and down the ranks.
[07:16 --> 07:21] As I've mentioned and as we'll see again, Placidia had begun gathering up an enormous
[07:21 --> 07:26] amount of influence for herself, and she was especially venerated by the auxiliary Goths
[07:26 --> 07:30] stationed in Ravenna, who still saw her as something like their queen.
[07:31 --> 07:37] So when rumors of Placidia's honor being threatened began to circulate, her supporters
[07:37 --> 07:39] were quick to make threats of their own.
[07:40 --> 07:46] So it could be that Honorius was actually exiling her to defuse the situation, or that
[07:46 --> 07:50] she was leaving because she realized she had become a focal point for possible violence.
[07:51 --> 07:56] It is also possible that after a decade spent as a hostage and a political asset to be ordered
[07:56 --> 08:01] around at will, the princess was simply looking to break free and establish her independence.
[08:03 --> 08:08] Whatever the real reason, Placidia and her two children, 4-year-old Honoria and 3-year-old
[08:08 --> 08:15] Valentinian III, sailed for Constantinople either in late 422 or when spring arrived
[08:15 --> 08:16] in 423.
[08:17 --> 08:19] Their timing could not have been worse.
[08:21 --> 08:27] When they arrived in the east though, everything was still A-OK, and they discovered that the
[08:27 --> 08:32] extended imperial family had grown yet again as Iliya Eudoxia had given birth to a healthy
[08:32 --> 08:37] baby girl named Licinia Eudoxia, who would wind up being the only surviving child of
[08:37 --> 08:39] the eastern emperor Theodosius II.
[08:40 --> 08:45] As soon as she was born, the older members of the Theodosian household got together and
[08:45 --> 08:50] agreed that when they came of age that the newborn Licinia would marry her second cousin
[08:50 --> 08:55] Valentinian III, arcing the family back in on itself much as the Julio-Claudians had
[08:55 --> 08:57] once so often done.
[08:59 --> 09:03] While the east was consumed with shutting down the war with Persia and deflecting the
[09:03 --> 09:09] southbound thrust of the Huns, and Gallipolisidia was consumed with trying to escape the oppressive
[09:09 --> 09:15] atmosphere of Ravenna, the army of the west was consumed with dramas of its own.
[09:17 --> 09:23] Since 411, the western legions had been unified in form and purpose by the iron will of Constantius
[09:23 --> 09:23] III.
[09:24 --> 09:28] But now that he was dead, that unity began to unravel.
[09:29 --> 09:34] Specifically, there were two officers who had been one step below Constantius III in
[09:34 --> 09:39] chain of command, and who might reasonably presume that their general's death meant
[09:39 --> 09:41] that they would rise to fill his shoes.
[09:42 --> 09:48] Unfortunately, these two officers, Castanus and Bonifacius, hated each other's guts,
[09:48 --> 09:51] which no, is not good for anyone.
[09:53 --> 09:57] The depths of their enmity became known as soon as Constantius was out of the picture.
[09:58 --> 10:03] In 422, the forces of the west were ready to make a concerted push into Hispania to
[10:03 --> 10:06] defeat the Vandal army led by Gunduric.
[10:07 --> 10:12] Castanus led one branch of the Roman army, composed primarily of Gothic auxiliaries,
[10:12 --> 10:16] while Bonifacius led another branch, composed mostly of regular legionaries.
[10:17 --> 10:22] As soon as they were in country, however, it became clear that the two Roman generals
[10:22 --> 10:24] were incapable of working together.
[10:24 --> 10:30] They squabbled over strategy and tactics and logistics, all to Gunduric's amusement,
[10:30 --> 10:31] no doubt.
[10:32 --> 10:36] Handel Bonifacius declared that he could take it no more, and withdrew with his forces south
[10:36 --> 10:39] across the Straits of Gibraltar into North Africa.
[10:41 --> 10:46] With the Roman forces in Hispania now at least following a single leader, Gunduric's amusement
[10:46 --> 10:51] dissipated, and Castanus was able to make inroads against the Vandals and reclaim bits
[10:51 --> 10:52] of occupied territory.
[10:54 --> 10:59] Gunduric's force was slowly being depleted day by day, and it actually looked pretty
[10:59 --> 11:05] bad for the Vandals, until some kind of mutiny broke out in Castanus's army that brought
[11:05 --> 11:07] a screeching halt to the whole campaign.
[11:08 --> 11:12] It is only mentioned that the Goths under Castanus's command betrayed him.
[11:13 --> 11:18] Whatever that actually means, he was forced to withdraw without having finished the job.
[11:20 --> 11:25] The next year, Castanus was back in Italy planning the next phase of the operation,
[11:25 --> 11:32] when on August 15, 423 AD, the Empire was rocked by the shocking news that Honorius
[11:32 --> 11:36] had died from what later scholars have diagnosed as edema of the lungs.
[11:37 --> 11:43] He was 38 years old and had ruled the Western Empire, though ruled is really not the right
[11:43 --> 11:47] word for it, for a kind of astounding 30 years.
[11:49 --> 11:55] All of the chaos of the last generation, the usurpations, the invasions, the palace coups,
[11:55 --> 11:59] and somehow Honorius had managed to survive it all and die of natural causes.
[12:00 --> 12:05] It is probably the single most impressive thing about his Imperial career, the simple
[12:05 --> 12:08] fact that he managed to live through it at all.
[12:11 --> 12:16] Now of course, as you are well aware, Honorius died without an heir of his own, which, as
[12:16 --> 12:21] we've noted, was no big deal these days because we've got a healthy young Valentinian III
[12:22 --> 12:24] ready to step in and don the purple.
[12:24 --> 12:30] Sure he was a baby, but of late, the Empire had come to accept minority emperors.
[12:30 --> 12:35] The point was, Valentinian III was the only living male relative of the dead emperor,
[12:35 --> 12:37] and he was the only one with a valid claim to the throne.
[12:39 --> 12:44] So no post-Honoria civil wars for control of the Western Empire, right?
[12:45 --> 12:53] Except that, oh yeah, Valentinian III is not in Ravenna, or Italy, or anywhere in the Western
[12:53 --> 12:53] Empire.
[12:54 --> 12:59] He is in Constantinople with his mother, which is about to complicate things.
[13:01 --> 13:07] I would guess that if Valentinian had been older, 15 or 20 or something, there would
[13:07 --> 13:08] have been no issue.
[13:09 --> 13:13] Word would have come over to Constantinople that Honorius was dead, Valentinian would
[13:13 --> 13:17] have sailed at once for Ravenna and stepped seamlessly into power.
[13:18 --> 13:24] But unfortunately, he had not yet been invested with any of the legal titles an heir usually
[13:24 --> 13:24] receives.
[13:26 --> 13:30] You'll recall, for example, that Honorius himself was likewise a young boy living in
[13:30 --> 13:36] Constantinople when his father died, but at that point he had already been made a Caesar
[13:36 --> 13:38] and then an Augustus.
[13:38 --> 13:41] Valentinian was as of yet neither.
[13:42 --> 13:48] The Roman imperial family resembled a traditional royal family in almost every way, but they
[13:48 --> 13:54] still defined the political power structure by titles rather than by blood, and the scrupulously
[13:54 --> 13:59] litigious Romans couldn't help but notice that Valentinian did not yet hold any official
[13:59 --> 14:00] title.
[14:02 --> 14:06] Everyone had assumed he would take over the West from Honorius, but now that that day
[14:06 --> 14:09] was upon them, the matter was suddenly up for debate.
[14:09 --> 14:15] And without Gallop, Placidia, and Valentinian physically present in Ravenna to clamp down
[14:15 --> 14:20] on nonsense talk and drive the inheritance through, the nobility of Italy began to wonder
[14:20 --> 14:23] if there was not an opportunity here to be exploited.
[14:27 --> 14:31] The one person who could have really killed this debate was Theodosius II.
[14:32 --> 14:37] Now technically the only Augustus in the empire, he would have, by tradition, had the right
[14:37 --> 14:44] to nominate his cousin to the now vacant throne in Ravenna, but he declined to do so, possibly
[14:44 --> 14:48] thinking that he too had an opportunity here worth exploiting.
[14:49 --> 14:54] But without a clear idea of how he wanted to exploit the opportunity, Theodosius'
[14:54 --> 14:58] stalling merely emboldened the nobility in Italy to choose their own man.
[15:00 --> 15:05] With the general Castaness' backing, the chief notary of the Western Empire, a lifelong
[15:05 --> 15:09] bureaucrat named Ioannis, was declared Augustus of the West.
[15:11 --> 15:18] This elevation was recognized in Spain, Gaul, and Italy, all territories controlled by Castaness,
[15:18 --> 15:24] but it was rejected by the North African provinces, which were under the control of Castaness'
[15:24 --> 15:26] rival, Bonifacius.
[15:28 --> 15:33] Now Bonifacius' refusal to recognize Ioannis clearly stemmed, at least in part, from his
[15:34 --> 15:40] hatred of Castaness, but Bonifacius had also been helped into his high-ranking position
[15:40 --> 15:44] in the army by his friend and benefactor, Gala Placidia.
[15:45 --> 15:53] So not only was he 100% opposed to Castaness, he was 100% supportive of the rights of Valentinian
[15:53 --> 15:59] III, which meant that Ioannis was never, and I mean never, going to get Bonifacius' support.
[16:00 --> 16:06] And Bonifacius controlled North Africa, and as you are no doubt sick of me reminding you,
[16:06 --> 16:09] North Africa was where Italy got its food from.
[16:09 --> 16:15] So you guessed it, the minute Ioannis was elevated, Bonifacius cut off the grain.
[16:18 --> 16:22] As had been the case when Gildo had cut off the grain during Stilico's reign, however,
[16:23 --> 16:28] the severing of the food supply was not fatal to the self-proclaimed regime in Ravenna.
[16:29 --> 16:35] Sure, it undermined Ioannis and Castaness a bit, but it was not so debilitating that
[16:35 --> 16:36] it crippled them right then and there.
[16:38 --> 16:43] No one outright says this, but I reckon that this means Castaness followed Stilico's lead
[16:43 --> 16:49] and was able to organize relief grain shipments from Gaul to cover the shortfall for the time being.
[16:51 --> 16:56] This time being lasted for quite a bit longer than I would have thought Constantinople and
[16:56 --> 17:02] western allies of the imperial family would have let it, and the entire year of 424 passed
[17:02 --> 17:06] without any attempt to dislodge Ioannis being made.
[17:07 --> 17:12] There was probably some hope that the crisis could be resolved peacefully, and some fear
[17:12 --> 17:17] that peeling off troops to escort Valentinian III to Italy would open up the Danube frontier
[17:17 --> 17:19] to another Hun invasion.
[17:19 --> 17:25] And so it wasn't until the spring of 425, getting close to two years since the death
[17:25 --> 17:28] of Honorius, that enough finally became enough.
[17:29 --> 17:34] In the meantime, the only concrete step that had been taken to counter Ioannis and Castaness
[17:34 --> 17:40] was the elevation of young Valentinian to the imperial rank of Caesar, which gave him
[17:40 --> 17:46] the necessary legal authority he needed to claim the throne of the west, when it finally
[17:46 --> 17:48] came time for him to make that claim.
[17:51 --> 17:57] So, as I just said, in the spring of 425, this had all gone on long enough.
[17:58 --> 18:02] Constantinople mobilized an expeditionary force under the command of General Artaubour,
[18:03 --> 18:07] the man who had just recently led the Roman forces in the Far East during the brief war
[18:07 --> 18:09] with Persia.
[18:10 --> 18:15] With Valentinian and Gallipolisidia in tow, Artaubour's mission was to march on Italy,
[18:15 --> 18:20] destroy the upstart regime, and install Valentinian on the throne in Ravenna.
[18:22 --> 18:26] I'm not sure if the eastern forces took the land route in through the Alps, or if they
[18:26 --> 18:31] sailed their way in, but whichever it was, they managed to penetrate whatever defenses
[18:31 --> 18:34] stood against them and establish a foothold on the peninsula.
[18:36 --> 18:41] But it was not all smooth sailing, or smooth walking as the case may have been.
[18:42 --> 18:47] Shortly after arriving, the armies of east and west fought a brief and inconclusive battle,
[18:48 --> 18:53] which probably would have passed little noticed, were it not for the fact that during the fighting
[18:53 --> 18:57] Artaubour was taken prisoner and hauled up to Ravenna.
[18:58 --> 19:03] Still holding out hope that if they said and did all the right things that Constantinople
[19:03 --> 19:08] would recognize their regime, Ioannis and Castanets decided to let Artaubour live as
[19:08 --> 19:10] a sign of their good faith.
[19:10 --> 19:15] A decision that would prove to be their undoing.
[19:16 --> 19:21] While in captivity, Artaubour chatted up the guards and ministers who came and went, and
[19:21 --> 19:25] he managed to get his hooks into a member of Ioannis' inner circle.
[19:26 --> 19:30] Probably explaining that it was just a matter of time before the self-proclaimed regime
[19:30 --> 19:35] was toppled, and wouldn't it be better to help said toppling and live than to oppose
[19:35 --> 19:40] it and die, Artaubour convinced the minister to betray Ioannis.
[19:41 --> 19:46] Details are sketchy, but the next thing you know Artaubour is free, and Ioannis has been
[19:46 --> 19:52] kidnapped from the imperial palaces of Ravenna and spirited off to Aquileia, which the eastern
[19:52 --> 19:53] forces had seized control of.
[19:55 --> 20:00] Artaubour was not interested in showing Ioannis the same consideration that the general himself
[20:00 --> 20:05] had been shown after his own capture, and following a prolonged cycle of torture that
[20:05 --> 20:07] would-be emperor was beheaded.
[20:08 --> 20:13] With Ioannis dead, the fight went out of his supporters, and they rolled over.
[20:13 --> 20:18] Castanets was tracked down and either killed or exiled depending on which source you read,
[20:18 --> 20:21] and I would personally lean toward the former interpretation.
[20:22 --> 20:25] And Artaubour got green checkmarks up and down the board.
[20:26 --> 20:31] He had marched on Italy, defeated the upstart regime, and placed Valentinian on the throne
[20:31 --> 20:33] in Ravenna.
[20:33 --> 20:35] Loading Next Level.
[20:37 --> 20:42] The next level began with word coming in that before the eastern forces had arrived, Ioannis
[20:42 --> 20:47] had sent one of his commanders off beyond the Danube frontier to raise a relief army
[20:47 --> 20:53] from among the Huns, who this particular commander had had fairly extensive contact with during
[20:53 --> 20:54] his career.
[20:55 --> 21:00] That commander had succeeded in his mission and was now riding into northern Italy at
[21:00 --> 21:02] the head of a Hunnic army.
[21:03 --> 21:09] But he was exactly three days too late, and when the Huns arrived in Ravenna, they found
[21:09 --> 21:11] that he had already been seized by Artaubour.
[21:12 --> 21:16] The question of whether this newly arrived force would carry on the fight hung in the
[21:16 --> 21:22] air until Galloplicidius stepped in and put this little civil war to bed once and for
[21:22 --> 21:22] all.
[21:23 --> 21:28] The Huns were to be paid handsomely for their time if they agreed to head back to their
[21:28 --> 21:33] homes north of the Danube, and the commander would be given a high ranking position in
[21:33 --> 21:37] the western legions if he agreed to swear his loyalty to Valentinian.
[21:39 --> 21:44] The commander agreed and the crisis that had been sparked by the death of Honorius was
[21:44 --> 21:44] stamped out.
[21:46 --> 21:51] So who was this commander, who had been able to mobilize a force of Huns to fight for him,
[21:51 --> 21:54] and who was about to become one of the commanders in chief in Gaul?
[21:55 --> 22:01] He was a one Mr. Flavius Aetius, who was well on his way to becoming the most powerful man
[22:01 --> 22:07] in the western empire, and the man who would dominate the reign of Valentinian III politically
[22:07 --> 22:08] and militarily.
[22:12 --> 22:14] Aetius had been born around 390 in Moesia.
[22:15 --> 22:19] He was the son of a prominent Dacian soldier and an aristocratic Roman mother.
[22:20 --> 22:25] So unlike many of the Illyrian soldiers who had risen to prominence over the years, he
[22:25 --> 22:27] did not come from obscure peasant stock.
[22:29 --> 22:34] As a result of his essentially noble status, his early years did not follow the same arc
[22:34 --> 22:40] as his fellow soldiers, who endured the hardscrabble life of being a poor laborer before escaping
[22:40 --> 22:43] into the ranks of the army when they came of age.
[22:44 --> 22:49] Aetius was instead considered valuable enough that he was drafted to serve as a hostage
[22:49 --> 22:50] on behalf of the Roman Empire.
[22:52 --> 22:57] The exchange of hostages between allies, usually children to ensure maximum compliance with
[22:57 --> 23:04] the terms of whatever treaty, was an ancient tradition, and in 405 Aetius was one of the
[23:04 --> 23:08] hostages sent off by Stilicho to live with Alaric's Goths.
[23:09 --> 23:15] The teenager lived with Alaric for three years, until in 408 the chaos that resulted from
[23:15 --> 23:18] the fall of Stilicho led to his release.
[23:19 --> 23:24] Shortly thereafter, he was once again drafted as a hostage and sent to live with a branch
[23:24 --> 23:29] of the Huns, who the empire had recently come to an agreement of mutual understanding with.
[23:31 --> 23:35] Aetius lived with these Huns for an indeterminate amount of time, but likely for at least a
[23:35 --> 23:41] few years, before he returned to Roman territory and followed his father into the army.
[23:42 --> 23:48] These early experiences, the positive ties he forged with the barbarian communities he
[23:48 --> 23:54] lived with, put Aetius in a unique position to manage the 5th century empire as it wrestled
[23:54 --> 24:00] with the question of how to fight and how to live with the barbarian tribes inside and
[24:00 --> 24:02] outside of their territory.
[24:04 --> 24:10] Next week, Aetius will begin to show his savvy and his mettle when he arrives in Gaul to
[24:10 --> 24:12] take over his new command.
[24:13 --> 24:19] The Goths, now under the vigorous King Theodoric, had recently grown restless and were looking
[24:19 --> 24:22] to expand their territory beyond the confines of Aquitaine.
[24:24 --> 24:28] These were of course the very same Goths Aetius had spent three years of his life living with
[24:28 --> 24:33] twenty years earlier, and though he would show a remarkable firmness in putting the
[24:33 --> 24:38] Goths back into their place, he recognized the folly of treating them as anything less
[24:38 --> 24:42] than a powerful ally who had temporarily overreached.
[24:43 --> 24:48] The 5th century was a dangerous place and enemies lurked behind every shadow.
[24:49 --> 24:54] Aetius was going to make darn sure he didn't make new ones if he did not have to.
[24:55 --> 24:59] Especially when they might be needed to counter the biggest enemy on Aetius' radar.
[25:00 --> 25:06] No, not the Huns or the Vandals or the Franks, but the General Bonifacius down in North Africa,
[25:07 --> 25:13] who despised Aetius as he had despised Castanets, and who would likely stop at nothing until
[25:13 --> 25:15] Aetius was driven from power.

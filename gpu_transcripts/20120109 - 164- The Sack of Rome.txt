[01:16 --> 01:24] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 164, The Sack of Rome.
[01:28 --> 01:34] Okay, where were we? When we left off last time, the Western Roman Empire was
[01:34 --> 01:39] in the middle of a diplomatic crisis. The Gothic King Alaric had spent the last
[01:39 --> 01:44] year holding the city of Rome's head underwater, letting it up to breathe for
[01:44 --> 01:50] a bit before plunging it back underwater again as a part of a larger strategy to
[01:50 --> 01:55] force the Emperor Honorius to give in to his demands. But Honorius had
[01:55 --> 01:59] apparently concluded that since it wasn't his head in the bucket, he was
[01:59 --> 02:03] under no immediate pressure to make a deal with the Goths, even if, as we saw
[02:03 --> 02:08] at the end of the last episode, the deal on the table was a really, really good
[02:08 --> 02:14] deal for Rome. So we now find Alaric presently back in Rome, holding the
[02:14 --> 02:19] city's collective head underwater once again, this time with the added twist of
[02:19 --> 02:25] forcing the Senate to appoint a puppet emperor named Priscus Aetalus. Alaric
[02:25 --> 02:28] was probably hoping that the people of Italy would take note of how
[02:28 --> 02:33] disconnected from reality Honorius had become, how much his intransigence
[02:33 --> 02:37] threatened their lives and property, and how much better off they would be maybe
[02:37 --> 02:41] recognizing the Goth-backed Aetalus rather than continuing to support the
[02:41 --> 02:48] isolated and delusional Honorius. I say the people of Italy rather than the
[02:48 --> 02:53] people of the Western Empire because, as you'll also recall, control of the
[02:54 --> 02:59] had been lost back in 406, first to the semi-anarchy that had set in after the
[02:59 --> 03:04] barbarian invasion of New Year's Eve, and then to the semi-imperial order of the
[03:04 --> 03:10] usurper Constantine III. Not that he was actually a usurper anymore. Alaric's
[03:10 --> 03:14] presence in Italy had forced Honorius to recognize Constantine as a legitimate
[03:14 --> 03:19] imperial colleague. But if you thought that this recognition would prove to be
[03:19 --> 03:23] a boon to the fortunes of Constantine III, well, you just don't know the
[03:23 --> 03:29] 12th century. Just a few months after receiving a purple cloak in the mail
[03:29 --> 03:35] from Honorius, Constantine had to deal with a rebellion of his own. This new
[03:35 --> 03:39] rebellion had its genesis in a previous rebellion that had been organized in
[03:39 --> 03:45] Spain by members of the Theodosian household back in 408. Constantine had
[03:45 --> 03:50] dispatched his son Constans and one of his top generals, Gerontius, to put down
[03:50 --> 03:55] this revolt, which the Theodosians, not being the most popular family on the
[03:55 --> 04:00] block these days, they were able to do fairly quickly. Constans then returned to
[04:00 --> 04:04] his father's headquarters at Arles, leaving Gerontius in control of Spain.
[04:05 --> 04:10] Unfortunately, the general's ego swelled considerably at the sight of his
[04:10 --> 04:14] newfound autonomy, and he decided to challenge Constantine's rule by
[04:14 --> 04:18] arranging for his troops to elevate a local Spanish noble named Maximus to the
[04:19 --> 04:25] Augustus. As if that was not bad enough, Constantine found out about this little
[04:25 --> 04:30] rebellion at the same time he found out that a group of still hostile barbarians
[04:30 --> 04:34] had broken through the defensive lines keeping them penned into Gaul and they
[04:34 --> 04:40] were now crossing into Spain unchecked. Now you might think that this would be a
[04:40 --> 04:45] good thing for Constantine. You know, make Gerontius deal with the barbarians, get
[04:45 --> 04:49] enemies to fight each other, and then swoop in and knock out the exhausted
[04:49 --> 04:56] victor. But sadly, rather than fight, the two sides joined forces. Gerontius was
[04:56 --> 05:00] apparently able to get through to these tribes where Constantine had failed, so
[05:00 --> 05:07] rather than grinding each other down into dust, each reinforced the other. Now
[05:07 --> 05:11] facing an almost certain attack from the direction of Spain, Constantine was
[05:11 --> 05:15] further dismayed to learn that the province of Britannia, which had been the
[05:15 --> 05:20] cradle of his own rebellion, was now breaking off ties with him as well. After
[05:20 --> 05:25] Constantine had left with almost all the available Roman forces, the island had
[05:25 --> 05:30] come under heavy attack by Saxon pirates. Since Constantine appeared disinterested
[05:30 --> 05:35] in their plight, in late 409 the people of Britain ejected Constantine's few
[05:35 --> 05:39] remaining officials and took the defense and governance of their island into
[05:39 --> 05:45] their own hands. Just that spring, Constantine III had been the recognized
[05:45 --> 05:49] and legitimate ruler of the entire northwest quadrant of the Roman Empire.
[05:50 --> 05:55] Now he was surrounded by enemies defending an ever smaller patch of grass
[05:55 --> 06:03] in the middle of Gaul. Over the winter of 409-410, Constantine meditated on his
[06:03 --> 06:08] ever-worsening position and resolved to make one last high-risk play to salvage
[06:08 --> 06:14] the situation. When spring came, he was going to invade Italy and depose
[06:14 --> 06:20] Honorius. He had been in contact with members of the Ravenna court, who were
[06:20 --> 06:24] thoroughly dissatisfied with the Emperor, and they had encouraged Constantine to
[06:24 --> 06:29] march across the Alps and topple him from power. As soon as the passes thawed,
[06:30 --> 06:35] Constantine was on the move. Now unfortunately for us, the details of this
[06:35 --> 06:41] campaign are sketchy, and all we really know is that the invasion failed. Honorius
[06:41 --> 06:45] had been reinforced by troops from the east, helpfully provided by the eastern
[06:45 --> 06:50] prefect Anthemius, who had every reason to want Honorius to remain in power,
[06:50 --> 06:54] which combined with the fact that Constantine's own force could not have
[06:54 --> 06:58] been that large, it was probably enough to send the general scurrying back to
[06:59 --> 07:07] Meanwhile, down in Rome, Alaric was having problems of his own. He had made
[07:07 --> 07:13] Priscus Ataullus Augustus for two basic reasons. First, to gain leverage in his
[07:13 --> 07:17] negotiations with Honorius, and second, to have a puppet civil official on the
[07:17 --> 07:23] throne who would do what Alaric told him to do. Ataullus was failing him on both
[07:23 --> 07:28] fronts. Honorius seemed more resistant than ever to negotiations, especially
[07:28 --> 07:33] after successfully repelling Constantine, and far from acting as a mere puppet,
[07:34 --> 07:38] Ataullus was challenging and resisting Gothic commands, most especially on the
[07:38 --> 07:45] question of North Africa. Alaric wanted Ataullus to cross over and seize control
[07:45 --> 07:50] of the all-important grain supply chain, which Ataullus was fine with, but not if
[07:50 --> 07:55] it meant using Gothic forces. Ataullus did not like the optics of using
[07:55 --> 08:00] foreigners to seize Roman territory. If he was going to do it, he was going to
[08:00 --> 08:04] use regular Roman forces to do it, which would at least give the operation a
[08:04 --> 08:09] veneer of legal dignity. But of course, Ataullus didn't have sufficient regular
[08:09 --> 08:14] forces available to pull off the operation, so his refusal to use the
[08:14 --> 08:20] Goths meant that he was refusing to go seize North Africa. Annoyed that his
[08:20 --> 08:24] creation was frustrating rather than facilitating his plans, Alaric
[08:24 --> 08:30] unceremoniously deposed Ataullus in early 410. But don't worry, kids, we haven't
[08:30 --> 08:38] heard the last of Priscus Ataullus. So now Alaric was back to square one, and to
[08:38 --> 08:42] make matters worse, there had been a power shift up in the Ravenna court that
[08:42 --> 08:48] did not bode well for the Gothic king. Olympius, the man who had engineered
[08:48 --> 08:53] Stilicho's execution, had fallen from favor, and he had been replaced by
[08:53 --> 08:57] Sarus, the Gothic general who had defected to Rome's banner following the
[08:57 --> 09:03] Battle of Verona in 402. This was a rotten development for Alaric, because
[09:03 --> 09:08] where Olympius had stymied negotiations because of a general anti-barbarian bias,
[09:09 --> 09:14] Sarus is about to stymie negotiations because of a specific hatred of Alaric.
[09:15 --> 09:20] Their two families had been rivals within the Gothic community for I don't
[09:20 --> 09:24] even know how long, and after the defeat at Verona, Sarus had taken the
[09:24 --> 09:28] opportunity to throw his lot in with Rome rather than continue to take orders
[09:28 --> 09:33] from the hated and now beaten Alaric. So if Alaric thought he had trouble
[09:33 --> 09:38] extracting concessions from Honorius before, well, now that his blood enemy
[09:38 --> 09:45] Sarus had the Emperor's ear, there was no chance of anything ever getting done.
[09:46 --> 09:50] Alaric pressed on, however, and in midsummer he was back in North Italy to
[09:50 --> 09:56] resume negotiations with Ravenna. When these talks appeared to be progressing,
[09:56 --> 10:01] Sarus used his authority as commander of the Emperor's troops to destroy any and
[10:01 --> 10:06] all goodwill between the two sides. Without warning, he ordered his troops to
[10:06 --> 10:11] attack a contingent of Alaric's army. Nothing came of the battle and it did not
[10:11 --> 10:16] drive the two sides into open war, but it did convince Alaric that talking was
[10:16 --> 10:21] officially hopeless. He was never going to get anywhere he wanted to go by
[10:21 --> 10:28] remaining at the bargaining table. It was time to act. So he withdrew back to
[10:28 --> 10:33] Rome and placed it under siege for the third time in just over a year. But this
[10:33 --> 10:38] time, it was not a negotiating tactic. He was not waiting for the Senate to buy him off.
[10:39 --> 10:44] No, this time he was going all in. The Goths were going to sack Rome.
[10:47 --> 10:52] As the siege began, the first major prize of the assault fell into Alaric's lap.
[10:53 --> 10:58] Gallia Placidia, the youngest daughter of Theodosius and one-time fiance of
[10:58 --> 11:04] Stilicho's now-dead son, Eucharius, had been living in Rome following Olympias' coup.
[11:04 --> 11:08] And when this much more serious siege began, she attempted to flee the city.
[11:10 --> 11:15] Captured by Gothic soldiers, she became a highly valuable hostage to the Gothic cause.
[11:16 --> 11:22] As we will see, Placidia's stay with the Goths would not be temporary and it would be
[11:22 --> 11:27] a full decade before she was released back into the custody of the Ravenna court.
[11:28 --> 11:35] But fear not, she was no passive hostage. Her capture in 410 was simply the beginning of a
[11:35 --> 11:40] remarkable political career that will see her first influencing and then outright
[11:40 --> 11:47] directing Roman state policy until her death in 450. We will have much more to say
[11:47 --> 11:53] about good Gallia Placidia as we move forward. So, welcome to the stage, your highness.
[11:56 --> 12:04] Which brings us to, yes, here we are. Way back in episode 10, Barbarians at the Gates,
[12:05 --> 12:09] we discussed the sacking of Rome by Brennus and his long-haired Gauls.
[12:10 --> 12:15] When it was all over, I noted that it would be some 800 years before Rome was sacked again.
[12:16 --> 12:24] Well, here we are, 800 years and 170 odd episodes later on the extreme opposite end
[12:24 --> 12:31] of the bell curve of Rome's power. On August the 24th, 410 A.D., slaves inside Rome
[12:31 --> 12:36] opened the Salarian Gate, allowing Alaric and his Goths to come flooding into the city.
[12:37 --> 12:43] The Roman city militia, just enough to man the impressive Aurelian walls, had no hope
[12:43 --> 12:49] of standing against the Goths in open combat. For the first time in almost a millennium,
[12:49 --> 12:59] Rome was helpless and at the mercy of an enemy. But interestingly, there was mercy to be had.
[13:00 --> 13:06] As I've mentioned in passing, Alaric sack of Rome was not an unrestrained anarchic affair.
[13:07 --> 13:13] At this point, both the sacking Goths and the sacked Romans were Christians of one
[13:13 --> 13:18] sort or another, so Alaric declared churches and religious artifacts to be off limits.
[13:19 --> 13:25] Further, he sent out word to the citizens of the city that anyone taking refuge in a
[13:25 --> 13:30] church would be left alone. Blood would not be spilled in the houses of God.
[13:32 --> 13:38] But beyond that, well, this was an exercise in punitive plundering, so some things got
[13:38 --> 13:45] to be fair game, and indeed most things were. The wealth of the lavish homes and old imperial
[13:45 --> 13:52] residences were stripped, stuffed into bags, and carted off. Citizens caught out of designated
[13:52 --> 13:58] safe areas were beaten, raped, and killed. The old pagan temples were looted without
[13:58 --> 14:03] compunction, and it is with a heavy heart that I report that this is the moment when
[14:03 --> 14:09] the ashes of Augustus, Hadrian, and so many other great imperial figures, which had been
[14:09 --> 14:15] kept safe for centuries inside of their mausoleums, were toppled and scattered to the winds of
[14:15 --> 14:22] time. For three days, the Goths ran amuck on a destructive treasure hunt that saw the
[14:22 --> 14:27] best of classical Rome looted, broken, or lost.
[14:31 --> 14:37] Now the Sack of Rome was no great strategic blow to the Empire in military terms. Politically,
[14:38 --> 14:43] it did not signal the end of the old imperial order, and in terms of the decline and fall
[14:43 --> 14:50] of the Western Empire as a whole, it was more mile post than destination. But that does
[14:50 --> 14:57] not mean that it was not a major blow to the citizens of the Empire at the time. Morale
[14:57 --> 15:02] had been wavering for years, and the thought of barbarians pillaging the eternal city
[15:02 --> 15:07] was so inconceivable that when it happened, a sort of confused despair seemed to settle
[15:07 --> 15:14] in. The psychological shock waves were strong enough that it drove Saint Augustine, the
[15:14 --> 15:19] bishop of the North African port of Hippo, to begin writing The City of God, a massive
[15:19 --> 15:24] political and religious treatise defending Christianity from the increasingly pervasive
[15:24 --> 15:32] view that Rome had been sacked because it had abandoned its pagan heritage. Augustine
[15:32 --> 15:37] did not dwell on religious cause and effect, so much as he argued that everyone was missing
[15:37 --> 15:44] the point. We ought to be dedicating ourselves to the eternal and non-coporial City of God,
[15:44 --> 15:50] as revealed through the divine incarnation of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, rather than
[15:50 --> 15:57] writing about what happens to the base and worldly city of man. This call not to save
[15:57 --> 16:03] Rome, but to look past it, was a powerful comfort to a population facing what looked
[16:03 --> 16:10] an awful lot to them like the end of the world. When published, The City of God almost immediately
[16:10 --> 16:15] became the official political platform of the Catholic Church, and it maintained that
[16:15 --> 16:22] disputed place until St. Thomas Aquinas came along in the 1200s and offered his Aristotelian
[16:22 --> 16:30] revisions. Meanwhile, back in the city of man, the Goths had reached their load limit
[16:30 --> 16:35] after three days of looting, and Alaric led his men out of Rome, laden with treasure.
[16:37 --> 16:41] As the barbarian masses disappeared over the southern horizon, the people of the eternal
[16:41 --> 16:47] city were left to pick up the pieces of their shattered city. Some resolved to stay and
[16:47 --> 16:54] rebuild, but most looked at the trash shops and broken homes and asked, why bother? Refugees
[16:54 --> 17:00] began to stream out of Rome, beginning a cycle of economic depression, exodus, further economic
[17:00 --> 17:05] depression, and further exodus that would in time take Rome from a population high of
[17:05 --> 17:10] perhaps a million people, down to a low of just 20,000 during the Middle Ages.
[17:14 --> 17:19] After rocking the Roman world by sacking its most sacred city, though, Alaric did not dwell
[17:19 --> 17:24] on the place he had just earned for himself in history. He was already on to the next big
[17:24 --> 17:31] thing. The sack of Rome had gotten him a lot of stuff, but it had not gotten him the peace,
[17:31 --> 17:38] security, or power that he was really looking for. If threatening and then looting Rome
[17:38 --> 17:43] had not been enough to shake Honorius out of his stubborn stupor, then maybe cutting off
[17:43 --> 17:49] the Italian food supply would be. The Gothic king led his people south to the toe of the
[17:49 --> 17:56] peninsula of Italy, where he planned to launch an invasion of North Africa. Seizing the African
[17:56 --> 18:01] grain supply had long been on Alaric's to-do list, and after failing to push Attalus into
[18:01 --> 18:07] doing his dirty work for him, Alaric decided to take matters into his own hands. But the
[18:07 --> 18:12] cobbled together Gothic fleet of mostly stolen ships hit a storm almost as soon as they
[18:12 --> 18:16] launched, and they were forced back to the safety of the Italian harbors.
[18:19 --> 18:24] While the Goths regrouped and planned their next move, they were hit with a further and
[18:24 --> 18:32] potentially more debilitating setback. In the autumn of 410, Alaric caught a fever and
[18:32 --> 18:38] he died. He was in his early 40s and was just months removed from the signature event that
[18:38 --> 18:44] would ensure his name was and will be seared into the history books for all time.
[18:46 --> 18:54] Fearful that their dead leader's body would be desecrated if left out in the open, the
[18:54 --> 18:58] Goths sent Alaric in the dry bed and then returned the stream to its natural course.
[18:59 --> 19:04] Neither Alaric's body nor the hoard of treasure that would have presumably been buried with
[19:04 --> 19:06] him was ever found.
[19:10 --> 19:15] Control of the Goths fell to Alaric's brother Attalus, who will lead them for the next five
[19:15 --> 19:21] tumultuous years, as they marched from Italy to Gaul and from Gaul to Spain, making, breaking,
[19:21 --> 19:27] and then remaking alliances along the way as the Western Roman world, sometimes violently
[19:27 --> 19:30] and sometimes diplomatically, reshaped itself.
[19:33 --> 19:38] The geographic center of that reshaping would be Gaul, where the political and military
[19:38 --> 19:44] power of the Western Empire was about to fracture still further, before being cobbled back
[19:44 --> 19:50] together by a dour general who history has come to know as Constantius III.
[19:53 --> 19:59] Constantius was of Illyrian origin, and likely came up through the ranks of Theodosius's
[19:59 --> 20:05] post-Adrianople Eastern legions before, like Stilicho, following the Emperor West to put
[20:05 --> 20:07] down the revolt of Eugenius and Arbogast.
[20:08 --> 20:14] He doesn't really pop into recorded history until 411, though, so it is simply an educated
[20:14 --> 20:20] guess that his career followed an arc similar to Stilicho's, to whom it is also educatedly
[20:20 --> 20:24] guessed Constantius was a loyal subordinate of.
[20:26 --> 20:31] In 411, though, he had risen high enough that Honorius appointed him to the task of finally
[20:31 --> 20:36] taking down Constantine III, who was, presently back in Gaul, holding down that ever-shrinking
[20:36 --> 20:39] patch of grass from his headquarters in Arles.
[20:41 --> 20:47] But as Constantius readied the Italian army for war with Constantine, word came down that
[20:47 --> 20:49] things had become a wee bit more complicated.
[20:51 --> 20:56] The general, Gerontius, had finally launched his expected attack from Spain, and after
[20:56 --> 21:01] defeating a division of Constantine's forces near modern Vienna, he had moved on to Arles
[21:01 --> 21:03] and put the city to siege.
[21:04 --> 21:10] So now Constantius was facing two hostile armies in the same place at the same time.
[21:11 --> 21:14] To get to Constantine, he would have to go through Gerontius.
[21:16 --> 21:21] Rather than wait for the two enemy armies to wear each other out, however, Constantius
[21:21 --> 21:26] decided to aggressively move in and attack Gerontius while he was still occupied with
[21:26 --> 21:26] his siege.
[21:28 --> 21:34] This proved to be a winning strategy, because Gerontius's disunited army of barbarians
[21:34 --> 21:39] and regular Roman forces panicked at the first sight of Constantius's army, and most of
[21:39 --> 21:45] Gerontius's men chose to desert to the approaching Italian army rather than fight a battle trapped
[21:45 --> 21:47] against the walls of Arles.
[21:48 --> 21:53] Abandoned by his troops, Gerontius fled, but he appears to have been tracked down and cornered
[21:53 --> 21:58] by Spanish soldiers from his own ex-army, and likely killed himself after becoming trapped.
[22:02 --> 22:07] Back in Arles, the breaking of Gerontius's army had done nothing to improve the situation
[22:07 --> 22:12] for Constantine, however, as Constantius simply stepped in and resumed the siege.
[22:14 --> 22:18] Constantine's only hope was that Frankish reinforcements from the lower Rhine would
[22:18 --> 22:20] arrive in time to lift the siege.
[22:20 --> 22:26] But, though said reinforcements did arrive in time, Constantius simply drove them off.
[22:27 --> 22:30] Which is not so good if that was your only hope.
[22:31 --> 22:33] And, indeed it was.
[22:33 --> 22:39] When Constantine desperately called for reinforcements a second time, the call was ignored by the
[22:39 --> 22:40] soldiers remaining in the lower Rhineland.
[22:41 --> 22:42] They were no dummies.
[22:42 --> 22:44] They could see which way the winds were blowing.
[22:46 --> 22:48] Constantine was now on his own.
[22:50 --> 22:54] Constantius sent a note into the city promising that if Constantine ended his resistance
[22:54 --> 22:57] and handed himself over, that he would be allowed to live.
[22:59 --> 23:04] Recognizing that his position was hopeless, Constantine agreed to the terms and surrendered.
[23:05 --> 23:11] But as was so often the case in these situations, Constantius's deal was just a ruse to lure
[23:11 --> 23:16] Constantine out of the city, and the captured general was executed while on the road from
[23:16 --> 23:18] Arles to Ravenna.
[23:20 --> 23:22] Okay, so that's it then, right?
[23:22 --> 23:28] Constantius has come along, saved the day, and defeated all existing enemies of the Imperial
[23:28 --> 23:28] Throne.
[23:29 --> 23:33] The Western Empire is now back under the united control of Ravenna.
[23:33 --> 23:34] Right?
[23:35 --> 23:37] Oh, would that it were so.
[23:38 --> 23:44] But as Arles was falling, a new, new usurper appeared along the lower Rhine.
[23:45 --> 23:50] The forces gathered there, dominated by a mix of Franks, Burgundians, and Alans, had
[23:50 --> 23:54] been aligned with Constantine until they stopped returning his phone calls.
[23:56 --> 24:00] When it became clear that their patron was going down, they grabbed a local Gallic noble
[24:00 --> 24:05] named Jovinus and hailed him as Augustus in the city of Mainz.
[24:06 --> 24:11] Like an oversized game of whack-a-mole, as one usurper got whacked, another popped up
[24:11 --> 24:12] on the other side of the board.
[24:14 --> 24:19] But before he could deal with this new, new usurper, Constantius was going to have to
[24:19 --> 24:22] come back to Italy and deal with a more immediate problem.
[24:23 --> 24:28] Aetolth and the Goths had been making their way north and were now getting a bit too close
[24:28 --> 24:30] to Ravenna for anyone's comfort.
[24:31 --> 24:37] So Constantius headed back across the Alps to hopefully push the Goths out of Italy once
[24:37 --> 24:38] and for all.
[24:40 --> 24:46] Next week, Constantius will succeed in pushing the Goths out of Italy, but rather than driving
[24:46 --> 24:52] them east, back to Illyria, they will instead press on north to the newly pacified, but
[24:52 --> 24:54] still fragile, southern Gaul.
[24:55 --> 25:00] As you can imagine, the appearance of this Gothic horde is going to have a major impact
[25:00 --> 25:04] on the precarious military and political balance of the Northwest Empire.
[25:05 --> 25:07] Who will the Goths side with?
[25:07 --> 25:09] Who will they then betray?
[25:09 --> 25:15] And what would the ramifications be of a Gothic king, like say Aetolth, fathering a son with
[25:15 --> 25:18] an imperial princess, like say Gallia Placidia?
[25:19 --> 25:25] Would those ramifications be even more extreme if a childless emperor, like say Honorius,
[25:26 --> 25:29] were to die without naming a clear heir?
[25:29 --> 25:31] I think that they would.
[25:48 --> 25:54] Thank you for watching!

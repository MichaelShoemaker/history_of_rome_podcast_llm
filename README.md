## Dataset Information

The complete History of Rome series covers:
- **179 main episodes** (2007-2012): From Rome's founding to the fall of the Western Empire
- **13 additional episodes**: Updates, announcements, and special content
- **~150+ hours** of audio content
- **Comprehensive coverage**: 1,200+ years of Roman history

### Episode Range
- **Episodes 1-179**: The complete chronological history
- **Episode 1**: "In the Beginning" (753 BC - Founding of Rome)
- **Episode 179**: "The End" (476 AD - Fall of Western Roman Empire)
- **Special Episodes**: Updates and transitions to other series

## Quick Start

### 1. Download Episodes
```bash
jupyter notebook pull_episodes.ipynb
```
This will download all 192 MP3 files (~1.2GB total) to the `history_of_rome_episodes/` directory.

### 2. Transcribe Episodes

#### Option A: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended)
```bash
jupyter notebook parse_episodes.ipynb
```

#### Option B: Python Script (GPU Optimized)
```bash
python gpu_parser.py
```

### 3. Access Transcripts
Transcripts are saved in:
- `episode_transcripts/` - CPU-generated transcripts
- `gpu_transcripts/` - GPU-generated transcripts (faster)

## Transcript Format

Each transcript includes:
```
# 20070728 - 001- In the Beginning
# Detected language: en
# Duration: 708.10 seconds
# Model: medium, Device: cpu

[00:02 --> 00:05] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:06 --> 00:09] The founding of Rome is an event wrapped in myth.
[00:10 --> 00:14] Lacking a credible historical record, it is impossible to know exactly...
```

## Performance

### CPU Transcription
- **Speed**: ~0.5-1x real-time (30min episode = 30-60min)
- **Total Time**: ~384 hours for complete series
- **Memory**: ~2-4GB RAM required

### GPU Transcription (CUDA)
- **Speed**: ~2-4x real-time (30min episode = 7-15min)
- **Total Time**: ~96 hours for complete series
- **Memory**: ~4-8GB VRAM required

### Qdrant Example
```python
# Load transcripts into Qdrant for semantic search
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333)
# Process transcripts and create embeddings
# Enable queries like: "In Episode 57 Mike Duncan states that the Roman Empire..."
```

### Advanced Queries
```python
from utils import find_historical_figures, get_episode_summary

# Find all mentions of a historical figure
caesar_mentions = find_historical_figures(client, "history_of_rome", "Julius Caesar")

# Get episode summary
episode_44 = get_episode_summary(client, "history_of_rome", 44)  # "Caesar Triumphant"
```

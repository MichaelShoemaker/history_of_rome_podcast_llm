[01:02 --> 01:09] Hello and welcome to the history of Rome. Episode 116, here come the Illyrians.
[01:13 --> 01:19] As I said at the end of the last episode, the assassination of Gallienus in 268 marked the
[01:19 --> 01:25] beginning of the end for the crisis of the third century. In the 33 years since the death of
[01:25 --> 01:31] Alexander Severus, the Roman Empire had been on a pretty impressive downhill slide. Emperors were
[01:31 --> 01:38] dropping like flies, barbarians were running amok, the empire had broken in three, disease and famine
[01:38 --> 01:45] were rampant. But inch by inch and mile by mile, the successors of Gallienus are about to pull
[01:45 --> 01:52] Rome out of its skid and put it back on top of the geopolitical food chain. These successors were
[01:52 --> 01:57] notable not just for their achievements, but also for the fact that they all hailed from the same
[01:57 --> 02:04] part of the empire. Though I usually refer to the third phase of the crisis period as the recovery
[02:04 --> 02:11] phase, it could just as easily be known as the era of the Illyrian emperors. If anyone out there is
[02:11 --> 02:16] still clinging to the notion that the Roman Empire fell because it stopped being a Roman Empire,
[02:17 --> 02:21] well I can promise you that it would have fallen a whole lot earlier had it not been for the
[02:21 --> 02:26] succession of native Illyrians who pulled Rome out of the ditch that it had driven itself into.
[02:28 --> 02:35] Claudius, Aurelian, Probus, Diocletian, Constantine, these are the men who salvaged an
[02:35 --> 02:38] empire that looked like it was headed straight for the dustbin of history.
[02:39 --> 02:44] The Roman Empire wasn't a Roman Empire anymore, and it was a good thing for the Romans that it wasn't.
[02:48 --> 02:54] Despite his impressive sounding name, Marcus Aurelius Valerius Claudius most likely had no
[02:54 --> 03:01] aristocratic connections anywhere in his family tree. His origins are too obscure to say
[03:01 --> 03:05] definitively, but like other young men from the Daneb frontier who joined the legions,
[03:05 --> 03:10] he probably came from peasant stock and was looking for a ticket to a better life that
[03:10 --> 03:17] service in the army sometimes provided. Usually it provided hardship, suffering, and an early death,
[03:18 --> 03:22] but to the youths of Pannonia and Moesia that can't have sounded too different from the lives
[03:22 --> 03:28] they could expect to lead staying at home. At least in the legions there was an outside
[03:28 --> 03:32] chance you might get promoted to centurion or something and pick up a few cash bonuses along the
[03:33 --> 03:43] way. Born around 213, Claudius and his fellows would have entered the legions in the early 230s,
[03:43 --> 03:48] and though we know these years as the moment when the empire slipped into crisis mode,
[03:48 --> 03:55] for the common soldier these were the years when really anything became possible. A legionary who
[03:55 --> 04:01] showed courage, discipline, and who kept his wits about him in the heat of battle was likely to find
[04:01 --> 04:07] himself not just in charge of a cohort, but a whole legion, and after the ascension of
[04:07 --> 04:15] Maximinus Thrax, maybe even the whole empire. Claudius was courageous and disciplined and kept
[04:15 --> 04:22] his wits about him in the heat of battle, and so he slowly climbed up the ranks. He had the further
[04:22 --> 04:27] good fortune of coming into his own during the reign of Gallienus, when legions run by career
[04:27 --> 04:32] military men rather than the usual gang of aristocratic social climbers was becoming the
[04:32 --> 04:39] rule rather than the exception. Claudius seems to have excelled everywhere he went, and as
[04:39 --> 04:45] Oriolus faded as Gallienus' favorite general, Claudius stepped in and became one of the emperor's
[04:45 --> 04:52] most trusted military advisors. When Oriolus was stripped of the all-important cavalry command,
[04:52 --> 04:55] Claudius was quite literally handed the reins.
[04:58 --> 05:03] Claudius' role in the assassination of Gallienus the next year has never been fully ascertained,
[05:04 --> 05:07] but no one doubts that he was at least aware of the plot.
[05:08 --> 05:13] Constantine's revisionist historians attempted to absolve Claudius of all guilt,
[05:13 --> 05:16] but their claims are far-fetched to say the least.
[05:17 --> 05:22] As the senior ranking general of the officer corps, he was not only the natural choice to succeed
[05:22 --> 05:27] Gallienus, but also a man whose at least tacit consent would have been required for a plot to
[05:27 --> 05:34] move forward. On a more personal level, he was also the senior ranking Illyrian, and it was native
[05:34 --> 05:40] Illyrian officers who were the prime movers in the plot to remove Gallienus. To think that
[05:40 --> 05:45] Claudius did not know what his friends and countrymen were up to, strange credulity.
[05:46 --> 05:50] When the deed was done, the conspirators arranged for the men to proclaim Claudius Emperor,
[05:50 --> 05:53] and he accepted, no doubt feigning surprise.
[05:56 --> 06:00] Having assumed power by way of a coup though, Claudius was quick to distance himself from
[06:00 --> 06:07] the assassins and promote the legacy of Gallienus. In stark contrast to the rewards they were
[06:07 --> 06:12] probably expecting, Claudius singled out a number of the officers behind the plot to kill Gallienus
[06:12 --> 06:18] and had them executed or exiled. The new emperor wanted the world to know that he did not approve
[06:18 --> 06:23] of regicide, especially since he was now the rege who could possibly be cited.
[06:25 --> 06:30] To further distance himself from the conspiracy, when Claudius traveled to Rome to cement his new
[06:30 --> 06:37] powers, he took the surprising step of demanding that the senate deify Gallienus. The senate,
[06:37 --> 06:46] of course, balked at this. Far from wanting to deify Gallienus, when Claudius's order came down,
[06:46 --> 06:53] they were preparing to vote to damn his memory a la demission. Forced to swallow their pride,
[06:53 --> 06:56] which is of course what had made them so mad at Gallienus in the first place,
[06:57 --> 07:01] the senate instead voted to deify him, as Claudius instructed.
[07:01 --> 07:07] His hands now relatively clean, Claudius took stock of the empire he had inherited.
[07:10 --> 07:14] In the west, the Gallic empire was still in the hands of posthumous and looking as strong as ever.
[07:15 --> 07:20] Despite being solidly separatist though, the Gallic provinces maintained a non-aggressive
[07:20 --> 07:27] attitude towards Rome, so for the time being, they could wait. In the east,
[07:27 --> 07:32] Odinothus' death had led to the rise of his widow, Zenobia. There was definitely something
[07:32 --> 07:38] that needed to be done about that. It was one thing for the east to be run by Odinothus,
[07:38 --> 07:45] but his wife, this latter day Cleopatra, no, that wouldn't do it all. What if she decided to do
[07:45 --> 07:52] something crazy like take over Egypt? No, the east needed to be brought back under imperial control
[07:52 --> 08:00] and fast. But Zenobia too would have to wait. After all, had they not all just been involved
[08:00 --> 08:07] in staving off a massive Gothic invasion when Orioles had decided to revolt? Was that invasion
[08:07 --> 08:16] even over yet? No? Well, that is going then to have to be priority A1. So, after spending a few
[08:16 --> 08:21] months in Rome, Claudius ordered the troops in Milan back to the Danube, where either loose
[08:21 --> 08:26] Goths from the previous invasion were still running around, or a whole new invasion force
[08:26 --> 08:31] had come in, depending on which theory you buy into about the Gothic invasion patterns of the
[08:31 --> 08:40] late 260s AD. Well, that is, he headed over to the Danube directly from Rome as long as you believe
[08:40 --> 08:46] that one particular theory about Claudius' movements during his 18-month reign. I happen to believe
[08:46 --> 08:51] that theory, so that's the version of the story we're going with, but just so you know, there is
[08:51 --> 08:56] another theory that has Claudius dealing with the penetration of an Alamani horde into northern
[08:56 --> 09:02] Italy before he went to the Danube to face the Goths at Nicus. But this just doesn't seem logical
[09:02 --> 09:09] to me from the Alamani's point of view. The theory I happen to believe is that Claudius went to the
[09:09 --> 09:15] Danube, fought the Goths at Nicus, and while he was busy, the Germans made their move, and Claudius
[09:15 --> 09:21] was forced to return to Italy to deal with them. To argue that the Alamani invaded right away
[09:21 --> 09:26] means arguing that they decided to charge headlong into an imperial army still encamped
[09:26 --> 09:33] outside Milan, which maybe they did, but it just doesn't seem practical. Better to wait until the
[09:33 --> 09:38] Romans withdraw the bulk of their forces back to the Danube, right? That seems like the savvy play.
[09:38 --> 09:46] So, Claudius marched the imperial army back to the Balkans, where the withdrawal of Galienus the
[09:46 --> 09:53] previous year had left the Danube provinces open to further Gothic attack. Scholars have gone back
[09:53 --> 09:58] and forth about whether the threat Claudius rode off to face represented a continuation of the
[09:58 --> 10:04] previous invasion, or whether the Goths had abandoned Roman territory, regrouped, and were
[10:04 --> 10:10] now launching a second invasion. If there was a second invasion, it followed very closely the
[10:10 --> 10:16] route taken in 267, with a massive Gothic fleet heading down the Black Sea coast, passing into the
[10:16 --> 10:21] Sea of Marmara, and from there into the Aegean, sacking and pillaging all along the way.
[10:23 --> 10:29] When Claudius entered the Balkans, a Gothic horde, that is, women and children along with the men,
[10:29 --> 10:35] possibly 100,000 strong, was loose in the mainland. The Romans and Goths met outside the
[10:35 --> 10:41] city of Nices, and though we don't know the size of the army Claudius led, the Goths are said to
[10:41 --> 10:47] have fielded an army somewhere north of 50,000 men. The battle that followed was an extremely
[10:47 --> 10:54] hard-fought affair, but showing off that old Roman discipline, the Goths were finally broken,
[10:54 --> 10:59] when Claudius pulled the old, fake a retreat, then whirl around and smash your surprised opponent
[10:59 --> 11:05] trick. A trick likely led by his new cavalry commander, Lucius Domitius Aurelianus.
[11:07 --> 11:13] The Goths were mostly killed or captured, but even a victory as great as the one at Nices was not
[11:13 --> 11:21] decisive. A sizable contingent of the Goths managed to break free and push west into Macedonia.
[11:21 --> 11:27] Claudius wheeled his army around and caught the survivors trying to fortify themselves behind
[11:27 --> 11:33] their own carts. When Claudius broke through these defenses, the Goths once again took flight,
[11:33 --> 11:39] but as they had no provisions to speak of, the chase itself was taking more of a toll on their
[11:39 --> 11:44] remaining numbers than the Romans were. They finally holed up on the side of a mountain
[11:44 --> 11:50] and found themselves immediately besieged and trapped. Disease and famine ripped through the
[11:50 --> 11:55] Gothic ranks, and the chiefs quickly determined that they would not survive like this for very
[11:55 --> 12:02] long. So they broke out again, and amazingly enough, the starving and exhausted Goths managed to
[12:02 --> 12:08] penetrate the Roman line and point themselves towards home. But the final battle took too much
[12:08 --> 12:14] out of them, and the last of the last survivors were quickly tracked down by the Roman cavalry,
[12:14 --> 12:16] and with no strength left to fight, they gave up.
[12:16 --> 12:25] The fate of these surviving Goths might surprise you, but the circumstances of the times demanded
[12:25 --> 12:31] that the Romans break out of the old enslave and annex routine that had served them so well for so
[12:31 --> 12:38] long. The combination of disease and famine, near-constant warfare and economic upheaval
[12:38 --> 12:44] had left the empire, and particularly the Danube provinces, overworked and undermanned.
[12:44 --> 12:49] So Claudius decided to initiate a policy that had been used occasionally in the past,
[12:49 --> 12:56] but never in any sort of systemic way. He settled these conquered Goths inside the Roman Empire.
[12:57 --> 13:02] This had the effect of eliminating them as a foreign threat, putting them to work to boost
[13:02 --> 13:07] the Roman economy rather than suck it dry, and provide a new recruiting ground for the legions.
[13:09 --> 13:13] For their part, the Goths were more than happy to be allowed entrance into this world,
[13:13 --> 13:16] entrance into this rich land that they had for so long coveted.
[13:18 --> 13:22] Their brothers and sisters back north of the Danube were sure to take note of this shift in
[13:22 --> 13:28] policy, though they would be well advised to also note that only defeated barbarians
[13:28 --> 13:36] are allowed the privilege of Roman settlement. As we go forward, this policy of resettlement
[13:36 --> 13:41] and enrollment of the able-bodied men into the legions will become standard imperial policy,
[13:41 --> 13:46] and serve as one of the key strategies employed to maintain peace in the borderlands.
[13:47 --> 13:53] It should always be remembered that the massive defeat, for example, at Adrianople, was caused
[13:53 --> 13:59] not because the Goths were led into the empire by Valens, but instead because the migration was so
[13:59 --> 14:08] badly mismanaged. As with most of Rome's victories these days, there was not long to savor the win
[14:08 --> 14:15] at Nicus. After a ten-year hiatus, the Alamani got the band back together again, and decided
[14:15 --> 14:22] to launch a comeback tour through northern Italy. The presumption is that after their defeat near
[14:22 --> 14:28] Milan around 260, the Germans felt that they had made a peace deal between themselves and Galleinus
[14:28 --> 14:33] without necessarily recognizing the Roman state itself as a party to the negotiations.
[14:34 --> 14:40] So, when Galleinus died, well, that meant that it was now open season on Rome again.
[14:42 --> 14:47] My assumption is that they waited for Claudius to withdraw back to the Danube before they made
[14:47 --> 14:52] their move, but it could very well be that they invaded the minute that they heard the emperor was
[14:52 --> 15:00] dead. Whatever the order of events, the outcome was the same. Claudius and his imperial army
[15:00 --> 15:07] swept in and crushed the Alamani at Lake Benicus. The reported numbers have it that Claudius needed
[15:07 --> 15:15] just 35,000 troops to kill or capture half of the 100,000 men of the Alamani army, which would be
[15:15 --> 15:20] a stunning victory to say the least. But the enemy numbers probably refer to the whole Alamani
[15:20 --> 15:27] contingent, not just the fighting men, so it is likely that the battle itself was evenly matched.
[15:27 --> 15:33] Regardless, Claudius sent the Germans running home and established himself as basically the
[15:33 --> 15:40] greatest thing to happen to Rome in a long, long time. In the span of just a few months,
[15:40 --> 15:45] he had wiped the floor with the Goths and then the Germans and proved to the world that when it needed
[15:45 --> 15:52] it, Rome still had it. Best of all was the fact that Claudius was leading the legions to all these
[15:52 --> 15:58] victories personally, so there was no repeat of the whole victorious general-gets-proclaimed
[15:58 --> 16:03] emperor dynamic that had kept dividing the empire immediately after its victories in the field.
[16:07 --> 16:11] Rome's foreign enemies were knocked back on their heels enough that the emperor could begin
[16:11 --> 16:18] thinking about the real prize, the reunification of the empire. Though the situation in the East
[16:19 --> 16:25] was essentially the same as when he took office the year before, the situation in the West had
[16:25 --> 16:33] changed dramatically. Posthumous was dead, killed by his own troops, and the political stability
[16:33 --> 16:39] of the Gallic Empire was in serious doubt. Posthumous had been followed briefly on the throne
[16:39 --> 16:45] by a man with the auspicious name Marcus Aurelius Marius, but his reign had been measured in days,
[16:46 --> 16:50] and the Western provinces were now being controlled by a noble name Victorinus,
[16:51 --> 16:54] backed by the deep pockets of his mother, Victoria.
[16:56 --> 17:02] Only, the Western provinces Victorinus controlled were not the same as the Western provinces that
[17:02 --> 17:09] Posthumous had controlled. The Iberian peninsula took the death of Posthumous as an opportunity to
[17:09 --> 17:14] reconcile with Rome, and they switched their allegiance to Claudius, leaving Victorinus with
[17:14 --> 17:21] only Gaul and Britain as his domains. So, after defeating the Alamanni, Claudius peeled off a
[17:21 --> 17:26] good chunk of his army, handed it over to a lieutenant, with instructions to see how much
[17:26 --> 17:33] more of the Gallic Empire could be brought back into the Roman fold. The answer was not all of
[17:33 --> 17:39] it, as Claudius probably hoped, but was instead the not insignificant most of the Rhone Valley.
[17:39 --> 17:47] It was progress, and Claudius no doubt looked forward to being remembered as the man who restored the Empire.
[17:50 --> 17:55] He left this important mission to a lieutenant, because in mid-269,
[17:55 --> 18:00] a new player in our game began to mass on the Danube border, looking like they were looking
[18:00 --> 18:07] for trouble, the Vandals. As with the Goths, the true origins of the tribe that became known as
[18:07 --> 18:13] the Vandals is obscure, but most scholars agree that they came from somewhere in Scandinavia,
[18:13 --> 18:19] and were settled northeast of the region between the Danube and Rhine rivers by the first centuries
[18:19 --> 18:25] BC. Far enough off from the Empire that they were not major players in the early imperial battles
[18:25 --> 18:30] against their German neighbors, though it is recorded that Marcus Aurelius made a separate
[18:30 --> 18:35] peace with them during the Marcomannic Wars, as he was looking to isolate the tribes from each other.
[18:35 --> 18:41] During the population shifts of the third century though, they found themselves pressing up against
[18:41 --> 18:47] the borders of the Empire, and, likely hearing of the success the Goths were having, they decided
[18:47 --> 18:55] to take a crack at Rome themselves. Claudius and the rest of his army made first Sirmium,
[18:55 --> 18:59] the capital of lower Pannonia, which the Emperor planned to make his headquarters during the coming
[18:59 --> 19:06] offensive against the Vandals. But, if you listen closely to the section when I introduced the
[19:06 --> 19:15] Cyprian Plague, you know how this story ends. In January 270, Claudius, who would shortly become
[19:15 --> 19:21] known to history as Claudius Gothicus for his great victory at Nicus, came down with the plague,
[19:21 --> 19:27] and he died. He was 56 years old, and had ruled the Empire for just about 18 months.
[19:28 --> 19:32] Though his short reign was defined by military success against Rome's foreign enemies,
[19:33 --> 19:38] Claudius' most enduring legacy was the cabal of Illyrian officers he brought with him to the
[19:38 --> 19:46] forefront of Imperial politics. Most of the major military commands were now in the hands of his
[19:46 --> 19:52] countrymen, and for the next generation these Illyrian generals would dominate the Roman Empire.
[19:52 --> 19:57] Culminating in the reigns of Diocletian and Constantine, the Illyrian Emperors breathed
[19:57 --> 20:04] new life into a Roman Empire that had been at death's door. True, it would be a different
[20:04 --> 20:09] Empire that emerged on the other side, but it would still be an intact Empire,
[20:09 --> 20:13] and that was what counted. Antiquity was not dead yet.
[20:14 --> 20:16] Antiquity was not dead yet.
[20:20 --> 20:25] Claudius had been so consumed by his labors, though, that he never stopped to worry about
[20:25 --> 20:31] the little matter of who would succeed him when he died. So, when he did die, the question was
[20:31 --> 20:37] still hanging out there. As had happened when Decius died in the swamps of Abertus,
[20:37 --> 20:41] the Senate had one idea about who ought to rule, and the army had another.
[20:43 --> 20:48] But there would be no generous concord between these rival choices, as there had been between
[20:48 --> 20:55] Gallus and Hostilian. Twenty years of additional non-stop warfare had made the Senate beyond
[20:55 --> 21:01] irrelevant, and ignoring them would not really introduce any sort of significant discord into
[21:01 --> 21:06] the mix. As long as the armies were of one mind, the possibility of civil war was low,
[21:07 --> 21:11] and the armies were of one mind. They wanted Aurelian.
[21:12 --> 21:18] Back in Rome, the Senate elevated Claudius' brother Quintillus, but he never stood a chance,
[21:18 --> 21:24] and neither Aurelian nor his legions were too much worried about what the Senate thought about
[21:24 --> 21:33] anything. Lucius Domitius Aurelianus had been born around 215 in the province of Pannonia
[21:33 --> 21:39] to a tenant farmer of absolutely no consequence. He was just a few years younger than Claudius,
[21:39 --> 21:44] and so, like the now-dead emperor, Aurelian came of age just as the crisis of the third
[21:44 --> 21:50] century was heating up, and he thus spent his entire career embroiled in one war after another
[21:50 --> 21:56] and rising up through the ranks every time a vacancy opened up, which, during the tumultuous
[21:56 --> 22:04] mid-200s AD, was often. By the time of Gallienus' assassination, Aurelian was one of the top two
[22:04 --> 22:10] or three generals in the empire, closely associated with Claudius and the other Illyrian officers who
[22:10 --> 22:18] had taken over the high command of the legions. Known by the nickname Hand on Hilt or Sword in
[22:18 --> 22:25] Hand, Aurelian was known for being tough, humorless, disciplined, and focused. He tolerated
[22:25 --> 22:31] no fools, and likely would have been as hated an officer as the legions could spit out were
[22:31 --> 22:39] he not also fantastically talented and virtually unbeatable in the field. He took over command of
[22:39 --> 22:45] the mobile cavalry when Claudius became emperor, and ran them against the Goths at Nicis, leading
[22:45 --> 22:49] the offensive that initially broke the invaders and then leading the pursuit that finished them off.
[22:51 --> 22:55] He was unquestionably the number two man in the empire during the reign of Claudius,
[22:55 --> 23:00] and when the emperor succumbed to the plague in early 270, there was no doubt in the army's mind
[23:00 --> 23:07] who should replace him. Old Sword in Hand. They could not have chosen a better man for the job
[23:07 --> 23:19] that lay ahead. When Aurelian assumed the purple in 270, the empire was not only still divided from
[23:19 --> 23:25] itself, but in the east, Zenobia was making moves that signaled she had no intention of ever being
[23:25 --> 23:32] brought back into the Roman fold. Perhaps as early as the last few months of Claudius' reign,
[23:32 --> 23:37] Zenobia had ordered the Palmyrene army to enter Egypt and occupy Alexandria.
[23:39 --> 23:45] At no point had Gallienus ever granted Oedonothus access to Egypt, let alone had
[23:45 --> 23:49] Genomy over it, and Zenobia's move was nothing less than an act of war.
[23:49 --> 23:57] The maker-breakpoint had come in the relationship between east and west, and the new emperor Aurelian

[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 63, A Farewell to Claudius.
[00:14 --> 00:18] When we left off last time, Claudius was being informed that his cheating wife Messalina
[00:18 --> 00:19] had been executed.
[00:20 --> 00:24] Though her crime could easily be written off as a mere personal betrayal, when seen
[00:25 --> 00:30] vista of imperial politics, infidelity becomes indistinguishable from treason.
[00:30 --> 00:35] When the players involved are the emperor and the empress, simple domestic breakdowns
[00:35 --> 00:37] quickly become dangerous affairs of state.
[00:38 --> 00:43] Messalina's taking of a new husband created a dangerous new power center in opposition
[00:43 --> 00:45] to Claudius's existing imperial court.
[00:45 --> 00:50] As a result, Messalina and her lover, Silius, were not allowed to simply go along
[00:50 --> 00:55] their merry way and start a new life together, tainted a bit by scandal but ultimately no
[00:55 --> 00:56] worse to wear.
[00:57 --> 01:01] No, within days of the revelation of their secret marriage, they were both dead.
[01:01 --> 01:04] Silius by suicide, Messalina by execution.
[01:06 --> 01:10] A further consequence of the high vista of political power upon which the emperor
[01:10 --> 01:12] sat was that there was no time for mourning.
[01:13 --> 01:15] The search for a new wife began immediately.
[01:16 --> 01:21] But before we get into the details of Claudius's ill-fated marriage to his niece Agrippina
[01:21 --> 01:26] and the subsequent rise to power of her son Nero, I want to backtrack a little
[01:26 --> 01:31] bit and round out the accomplishments and failures of Claudius's administration, because
[01:31 --> 01:35] once Agrippina gets into the picture, dear Claudius will not be long for this world.
[01:37 --> 01:42] Perhaps the longest lasting contribution Claudius made to the empire was the series
[01:42 --> 01:44] of territorial annexations he initiated.
[01:45 --> 01:49] In addition to the envelopment of southern Britannia, which we have already covered,
[01:49 --> 01:54] Claudius's thirteen years in power saw the creation of a number of new provinces in
[01:54 --> 01:58] regions that had previously existed only as allied client kingdoms.
[01:59 --> 02:04] The territories in question were already firmly under Roman control, but Claudius
[02:04 --> 02:08] and his freedman secretariat recognized that the loose transactional nature of that
[02:08 --> 02:13] control was inefficient and ran counter to the centralized rational administration that
[02:13 --> 02:15] they were all working to create.
[02:16 --> 02:20] Probably first on the docket, though I can't seem to nail down a definitive date, was
[02:20 --> 02:25] the territory of Noricum, which had maintained its autonomy during the Augustan constitutional
[02:25 --> 02:29] settlement out of deference for Noricum's support of the Caesars during the various
[02:29 --> 02:30] civil wars.
[02:31 --> 02:35] This annexation amounted to little more than declaring it so, as Noricum was already
[02:35 --> 02:38] fully incorporated into the empire in every other sense of the word.
[02:39 --> 02:43] The locals accepted the change with a shrug, and you get the feeling that a few of them
[02:43 --> 02:46] might have actually been surprised to learn that they hadn't been a province this
[02:46 --> 02:47] whole time.
[02:48 --> 02:53] Next up were the territories of Lycia and Pamphylia in southern Anatolia, which
[02:53 --> 02:54] were annexed in 43 AD.
[02:55 --> 02:59] The region had existed as an independent federation of cities since the time of
[02:59 --> 03:04] the Third Macedonian War, but like I said, it was time to streamline imperial administration.
[03:05 --> 03:09] The locals were proud of their independence, but put up no great fight when word came about
[03:09 --> 03:11] the reorganization.
[03:12 --> 03:16] Finally came the official seizure of Thrace, the wild country between Macedonia and the
[03:16 --> 03:17] Hellespont.
[03:18 --> 03:22] The independent-minded Hill tribes of the region had long fought to maintain independence
[03:22 --> 03:26] not just from Rome, but also from each other, and when the Roman-backed, but
[03:26 --> 03:32] only vaguely recognized client-king of, quote, Thrace, was murdered in 46, Claudius
[03:32 --> 03:36] decided to just impose Roman order rather than go through another round of
[03:36 --> 03:39] inter-tribal squabbling about who ought to be the next king.
[03:41 --> 03:46] These acquisitions all went relatively smoothly, but two additional territories
[03:46 --> 03:48] gave the Romans trouble in their consolidation efforts.
[03:49 --> 03:53] In the west, Claudius inherited a mess created by Caligula in what would
[03:53 --> 03:56] become the two administrative provinces in Mauritania.
[03:57 --> 04:01] Back in 40 AD, Caligula decided that he wanted direct control of the region
[04:01 --> 04:05] and had invited the client-king of the North African territory to Rome for a meeting.
[04:06 --> 04:10] As soon as the unsuspecting monarch arrived, though, Caligula had him seized and executed.
[04:11 --> 04:16] Immediately, a revolt broke out back in Africa against the Roman officials sent by
[04:16 --> 04:18] Caligula to annex the region into the empire.
[04:19 --> 04:23] The incident played a part in the decision to assassinate Caligula as senators and
[04:23 --> 04:28] officials were appalled by the totally unnecessary destabilization of an otherwise
[04:28 --> 04:30] peaceful corner of the empire.
[04:31 --> 04:35] When Claudius became emperor, though, he was obliged to follow through on the annexation.
[04:36 --> 04:38] Whether or not it was the right thing to do was now irrelevant.
[04:39 --> 04:42] Men were up in arms against Rome and that was unacceptable.
[04:43 --> 04:46] Though most of the details have been lost, it seems that it took a few years to
[04:46 --> 04:50] put the revolt down before Mauritania too formally joined the empire.
[04:51 --> 04:56] In the east, Claudius dealt with the forever maddening province of Judea.
[04:57 --> 05:01] The region had been incorporated into the empire in 6 AD by Augustus, but after the
[05:01 --> 05:04] good poke in the eye Caligula had given the locals when he tried to have a
[05:04 --> 05:07] statue of himself placed in the Temple of Jerusalem,
[05:07 --> 05:11] Claudius thought it prudent to grant Judea autonomy under the rule of his
[05:11 --> 05:15] friend Herod Agrippa. When Herod Agrippa died three years later,
[05:15 --> 05:19] according to Christian tradition, smoten by the Lord for the crime of
[05:19 --> 05:23] imprisoning the Apostle Peter and executing the Apostle James, control
[05:23 --> 05:24] of Judea passed back to Rome.
[05:25 --> 05:30] Claudius then handed autonomy back to Herod Agrippa's son in 48 AD in an
[05:30 --> 05:34] attempt to maintain some kind of Roman jurisdiction over the notoriously
[05:34 --> 05:38] independent Jews who agitated constantly against foreign rule.
[05:39 --> 05:43] The relationship between Judea and Rome will remain contentious for years
[05:43 --> 05:48] until finally in 66 AD the so-called Great Revolt will break out leading to
[05:48 --> 05:52] the destruction of Jerusalem and the Jewish diaspora of 70 AD, which we
[05:52 --> 05:58] will deal with in more detail later. Taken as a whole, Claudius' reign marks
[05:58 --> 06:01] the most active in terms of territorial acquisition we have seen since
[06:01 --> 06:06] Augustus and will remain unmatched until Trajan gets the expansionary
[06:06 --> 06:11] itch in the early 100 AD. At thehistoryofrome.typepad.com there is
[06:11 --> 06:15] a map of all the provinces brought into the empire during these years.
[06:17 --> 06:20] In addition to his geographic reorganizations, Claudius also
[06:20 --> 06:25] reorganized the Roman political order. Possibly as a result of all the
[06:25 --> 06:28] assassination attempts he dealt with during the early years of his reign,
[06:28 --> 06:32] Claudius decided to reintroduce the long ignored office of censor,
[06:32 --> 06:36] which had been left vacant since the days of Augustus. You will recall
[06:36 --> 06:40] that in addition to the obvious duty of taking the census, the
[06:40 --> 06:43] censor also maintained the senatorial roles and acted as a sort
[06:43 --> 06:48] of moral policeman. A censor had the final say over who was in and
[06:48 --> 06:53] who was out of the Senate. Once upon a time, this had been meant to
[06:53 --> 06:56] ensure that crass and degenerate senators were replaced by more
[06:56 --> 07:00] worthy men. But in practice, this function became a political tool
[07:00 --> 07:05] used to keep allies and adversaries alike in line. Claudius desperately
[07:05 --> 07:09] needed to keep his adversaries and allies in line, so the emperor
[07:09 --> 07:13] stepped into the long vacant office in 47 AD and used its authority
[07:13 --> 07:17] to do some housekeeping. Claudius purged from the roles all the
[07:17 --> 07:20] families that had been suspected of plotting against him. Suddenly,
[07:20 --> 07:23] all the men who had fancied themselves possible candidates for
[07:23 --> 07:26] the emperorship due to their senatorial status, now found
[07:26 --> 07:29] themselves nothing more than mere private citizens without a leg
[07:29 --> 07:33] to stand on politically. And of course, in their place,
[07:33 --> 07:36] Claudius brought in men he could trust to be loyal or at the
[07:36 --> 07:42] very least apathetic towards his administration. Claudius also
[07:42 --> 07:45] took his reformation of the Senate one step further by looking
[07:45 --> 07:48] out to the provinces for eligible senatorial candidates.
[07:49 --> 07:52] Conservative guardians of Italian preeminence were shocked to now
[07:52 --> 07:56] find themselves seated alongside barbarian Gauls, who
[07:56 --> 07:58] Claudius had determined deserved to be seated due to
[07:58 --> 08:01] their longstanding loyalty to Rome and satisfaction of the
[08:01 --> 08:05] wealth requirements. It was a move that was hotly debated,
[08:05 --> 08:08] but Claudius held firm that the future strength of the
[08:08 --> 08:12] empire required Rome to admit the provincials as equal, just
[08:12 --> 08:15] as so long ago, the Latins had been absorbed into Rome, and
[08:15 --> 08:20] then later, the whole of the Italian peninsula. By degrees,
[08:20 --> 08:23] the Roman Empire must shed its strictly Roman identity and
[08:23 --> 08:26] embrace its multinational character if it's ever going
[08:26 --> 08:31] to survive. And in this, Claudius was exactly right. Had
[08:31 --> 08:33] the conservatives won the debate and kept the
[08:33 --> 08:36] provincials locked out, the Roman Empire likely would have
[08:36 --> 08:40] dissolved long before it did. I would also like to
[08:40 --> 08:43] mention at this point that Claudius was assisted in all of
[08:43 --> 08:47] this by a co-censor named Lucius Vitellius. I only bring
[08:47 --> 08:50] this up because Lucius Vitellius' eldest son, Aulus
[08:50 --> 08:53] Vitellius Germanicus, is one of the four emperors of the
[08:53 --> 08:56] chaotic year of the four emperors that followed the
[08:56 --> 09:00] suicide of Nero in 68 AD. And if I do this right, I
[09:00 --> 09:02] will have introduced all four of the four emperors by
[09:02 --> 09:05] the end of this episode. I've already mentioned
[09:05 --> 09:08] Vespasian, the man who will finally emerge victorious from
[09:08 --> 09:12] that chaotic year, so that is two down and two to go.
[09:13 --> 09:15] The last little episode I want to mention before we
[09:15 --> 09:18] get into Agrippina is the ill-fated draining of the
[09:18 --> 09:23] Fusine Lake. The idea was to increase the amount of
[09:23 --> 09:26] arable land by draining the 140 square kilometer
[09:26 --> 09:29] lake in central Italy, which had no natural outlet and
[09:29 --> 09:32] was a frequent source of malaria outbreaks. The
[09:32 --> 09:38] project was overseen by Narcissus, and over the
[09:42 --> 09:45] In theory, the lake would slowly and steadily disappear,
[09:46 --> 09:48] but on the big opening day of the drainpipe, which
[09:48 --> 09:51] included speeches, gladiatorial games, and much
[09:51 --> 09:54] pomp and circumstance, all that happened was that
[09:54 --> 09:57] everyone quickly discovered the tunnel contained too
[09:57 --> 09:59] tight a bend, which caused the whole system to back
[09:59 --> 10:01] up and wash out the site of all the ceremonies,
[10:02 --> 10:04] causing the emperor and all his assembled guests to
[10:04 --> 10:07] make a run for it. Not exactly his proudest
[10:07 --> 10:10] moment, but in defense of Claudius, he would not be
[10:10 --> 10:13] the last man to try and fail to drain the Fusine
[10:13 --> 10:16] Lake. It would not be until the 1800s that the
[10:16 --> 10:18] feat was finally accomplished by a Swiss engineer.
[10:20 --> 10:22] The spectacular failure of the project was an
[10:22 --> 10:24] embarrassment for Claudius, but it was an even
[10:24 --> 10:28] bigger one for Narcissus. It did not help that
[10:28 --> 10:31] Claudius's new wife Agrippina, whose elevation to
[10:31 --> 10:33] empress Narcissus had opposed, was using the
[10:33 --> 10:36] opportunity afforded by the debacle to accuse
[10:36 --> 10:39] Narcissus of embezzlement and incompetence. It
[10:39 --> 10:41] didn't really matter whether or not the charges
[10:41 --> 10:43] were true, though from everything I know about
[10:43 --> 10:45] the man, I actually find it pretty easy to
[10:45 --> 10:48] imagine Narcissus skimming a bit off the top.
[10:49 --> 10:51] No, what mattered was that Agrippina had her
[10:51 --> 10:53] chance to get rid of the troublesome freedman
[10:53 --> 10:56] who was allying himself with Claudius's son
[10:56 --> 10:58] Britannicus in what was shaping up to be
[10:58 --> 11:00] another dynastic struggle between the Julio
[11:00 --> 11:03] and Claudian halves of the family. In this
[11:03 --> 11:06] struggle, the new empress would prove to be a
[11:06 --> 11:08] formidable opponent in the game of power
[11:08 --> 11:14] politics. Julia Agrippina, known to us as
[11:14 --> 11:17] Agrippina Minor or Agrippina the Younger, was
[11:17 --> 11:20] born in November 15 AD, the eldest daughter of
[11:20 --> 11:23] Germanicus and his wife Agrippina. Named for
[11:23 --> 11:26] her mother, Agrippina Minor was carted around
[11:26 --> 11:28] the empire by her parents until she wound up
[11:28 --> 11:30] settled back in Rome following the death of her
[11:30 --> 11:34] father in 19 AD. From that point, she was
[11:34 --> 11:36] raised by her mother and then by her great
[11:36 --> 11:39] grandmother, Livia, who we will see seems to
[11:39 --> 11:42] have had a great influence on the child. In
[11:42 --> 11:45] 28 AD, Tiberius ordered the 13-year-old
[11:45 --> 11:47] Agrippina to marry the 40-plus-year-old
[11:47 --> 11:50] Gnaeus Domitius Ahenabarbis, who was the
[11:50 --> 11:52] grandson of Augustus's sister Octavia and
[11:52 --> 11:55] Mark Antony. Domitius was apparently
[11:55 --> 11:58] something of a cad, though the stories about
[11:58 --> 12:00] him were likely exaggerated to help reinforce
[12:00 --> 12:02] the despicable nature of his son, Lucius
[12:02 --> 12:05] Domitius Ahenabarbis, the future Emperor Nero,
[12:06 --> 12:10] who Agrippina gave birth to in 37 AD. To
[12:10 --> 12:12] avoid confusion, I am going to start calling
[12:12 --> 12:15] the boy Nero right now, even though he will
[12:15 --> 12:17] remain Lucius until his adoption by Claudius
[12:17 --> 12:21] in 50 AD. Nero would wind up being Agrippina's
[12:21 --> 12:24] only natural child as Domitius died of
[12:24 --> 12:26] congestive heart failure in January of 40
[12:26 --> 12:30] AD. You'll recall from the episode on
[12:31 --> 12:33] that at first Agrippina and her other
[12:33 --> 12:35] sisters were held in exalted status once
[12:35 --> 12:38] their brother became emperor. But after
[12:38 --> 12:40] the death of Drusilla, the relationship
[12:40 --> 12:41] between the remaining siblings seems to
[12:41 --> 12:45] have soured. As I mentioned, in 39 AD,
[12:45 --> 12:47] Agrippina and her sister Julia Lovilla
[12:47 --> 12:49] were accused of conspiring against their
[12:49 --> 12:52] brother's life with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus,
[12:52 --> 12:55] who was, A, the widower of Drusilla, B,
[12:56 --> 12:58] already tagged by Caligula as a potential
[12:58 --> 13:00] heir, and C, apparently the lover of
[13:00 --> 13:04] both Agrippina and Julia Lovilla. When the
[13:04 --> 13:06] plot was exposed, Caligula banished his
[13:06 --> 13:07] sisters to a small island in the
[13:07 --> 13:09] Tyrrhenian Sea, where legend has it
[13:09 --> 13:11] that he forced them to dive for
[13:11 --> 13:13] sponges to earn their room and board.
[13:14 --> 13:16] At this point, Agrippina had her
[13:16 --> 13:18] entire estate confiscated and her son
[13:18 --> 13:20] Nero was stripped of the inheritance
[13:20 --> 13:23] left to him by Domitius. Nero himself
[13:23 --> 13:25] was carted off to live with a
[13:25 --> 13:26] paternal aunt and did not seem a
[13:26 --> 13:28] likely candidate to survive childhood.
[13:31 --> 13:32] But Agrippina and Nero's fortunes
[13:32 --> 13:34] turn when Caligula was assassinated
[13:34 --> 13:37] in 41. Claudius recalled the
[13:37 --> 13:39] banished sisters and Agrippina and
[13:39 --> 13:42] her son were reunited. The now
[13:42 --> 13:44] penniless princess cast about looking
[13:44 --> 13:46] for a man with status and wealth
[13:46 --> 13:48] necessary to get her back into the
[13:48 --> 13:49] lifestyle to which she had grown
[13:49 --> 13:52] accustomed. According to Suetonius,
[13:52 --> 13:54] she set her sights on the already
[13:54 --> 13:56] married General Galba, but was rebuked.
[13:57 --> 13:59] Galba, of course, would eventually
[13:59 --> 14:00] become the first of the four
[14:00 --> 14:01] emperors in the year of four
[14:01 --> 14:03] emperors. So, hey, that's three
[14:03 --> 14:06] down and one to go. Agrippina
[14:06 --> 14:08] got over the rejection and moved
[14:08 --> 14:10] on to Gaius Solistus Crispus
[14:10 --> 14:12] Pacienus, who Claudius pressured
[14:12 --> 14:13] to accept Agrippina's advances.
[14:15 --> 14:16] Pacienus had already been
[14:16 --> 14:18] consul once and would be so again
[14:18 --> 14:20] in 44, so his high status
[14:20 --> 14:22] returned Agrippina to the
[14:22 --> 14:24] center of court life. But the witty
[14:24 --> 14:26] and vibrant Pacienus fell ill and
[14:26 --> 14:29] died in 47 A.D., leaving Agrippina
[14:29 --> 14:31] widowed once again, though this
[14:31 --> 14:32] time she emerged from her bereavement
[14:32 --> 14:35] an extremely wealthy woman. This
[14:35 --> 14:37] led to her very first accusation
[14:37 --> 14:39] of poisoning, which seems to be
[14:39 --> 14:40] something of a rite of passage for
[14:40 --> 14:43] Julio Caudi and women. When
[14:43 --> 14:45] Messalina was executed and the
[14:45 --> 14:46] emperor was left a bachelor, the
[14:46 --> 14:48] now single Agrippina defied
[14:48 --> 14:50] convention and good taste by
[14:50 --> 14:52] openly pursuing her uncle as a
[14:52 --> 14:53] potential husband.
[14:55 --> 14:57] As I said at the end of the last
[14:57 --> 14:59] episode, the execution of Messalina
[14:59 --> 15:01] led each of Claudius's trusted
[15:01 --> 15:02] freedmen to back a different
[15:02 --> 15:03] woman for the emperorship.
[15:04 --> 15:06] Narcissus backed Claudius's
[15:06 --> 15:08] former wife, Aelia Patina, and
[15:08 --> 15:09] Callistus backed Lolia Paulina,
[15:10 --> 15:11] who had been married to
[15:11 --> 15:12] Caligula for about six months
[15:12 --> 15:13] in 38 A.D.
[15:14 --> 15:16] Pallas, the secretary of the
[15:16 --> 15:17] treasury, meanwhile, pushed for
[15:17 --> 15:19] Claudius to do the unthinkable.
[15:20 --> 15:21] He and Agrippina had become
[15:21 --> 15:23] lovers, and if she became
[15:23 --> 15:25] empress, well, Pallas figured
[15:25 --> 15:26] that he would be set for life.
[15:27 --> 15:28] So he argued that the Julio
[15:28 --> 15:29] and Claudian wings of the
[15:29 --> 15:31] family must be reunited for
[15:31 --> 15:33] the dynasty and Rome to survive.
[15:34 --> 15:35] Claudius was swayed by these
[15:35 --> 15:37] arguments and took the same
[15:37 --> 15:38] line to the Senate when he
[15:38 --> 15:39] announced his intention to
[15:39 --> 15:40] marry his own niece.
[15:41 --> 15:42] It was for the good of the
[15:42 --> 15:44] empire, Claudius said, and
[15:44 --> 15:45] you should treat it as such and
[15:45 --> 15:47] not think too hard about the
[15:47 --> 15:49] clear-cut incestual union I'm
[15:49 --> 15:50] posing here.
[15:51 --> 15:52] The Senate wasn't very happy
[15:52 --> 15:54] about it, but they relented
[15:54 --> 15:55] and backed the marriage.
[15:55 --> 15:57] The people of Rome, however,
[15:57 --> 15:58] were not so understanding and
[15:58 --> 16:00] refused to get on board with
[16:00 --> 16:00] the program.
[16:01 --> 16:02] The marriage would spark a
[16:02 --> 16:04] precipitous decline in
[16:04 --> 16:05] Claudius' popularity.
[16:08 --> 16:09] Agrippina had gone through a
[16:09 --> 16:10] number of image makeovers in
[16:10 --> 16:12] her life, from pitiable
[16:12 --> 16:13] daughter of Germanicus to
[16:13 --> 16:15] immoral harlot of
[16:15 --> 16:16] Caligula's court to
[16:16 --> 16:18] sympathetic exiled mother.
[16:18 --> 16:19] With her marriage to
[16:19 --> 16:21] Claudius on New Year's Day 49
[16:21 --> 16:22] A.D., though, she
[16:22 --> 16:23] crystallized into the woman
[16:23 --> 16:25] history remembers her as,
[16:25 --> 16:27] the ruthlessly ambitious
[16:27 --> 16:28] empress of Rome.
[16:29 --> 16:31] Much like Livia before her,
[16:31 --> 16:33] Agrippina poured her ambition
[16:33 --> 16:34] into the only vessel a
[16:34 --> 16:36] woman like her could use to
[16:36 --> 16:37] gain and hold power in
[16:37 --> 16:39] patriarchal Rome, her son.
[16:41 --> 16:42] Even before her marriage to
[16:42 --> 16:44] Claudius, Agrippina was
[16:44 --> 16:45] hard at work setting Nero
[16:45 --> 16:46] up for success.
[16:47 --> 16:49] In 48, she had conspired
[16:49 --> 16:50] with the aforementioned
[16:50 --> 16:51] co-sensor Vitellius to
[16:51 --> 16:53] smear the fiancee of
[16:53 --> 16:54] Claudius' daughter,
[16:54 --> 16:55] Claudia Octavia, to clear
[16:55 --> 16:57] the way for Nero to marry
[16:57 --> 16:58] into the imperial family.
[16:59 --> 17:00] Agrippina succeeded in
[17:00 --> 17:01] breaking up the engagement,
[17:02 --> 17:03] leading said fiancee to
[17:03 --> 17:04] commit suicide along the
[17:04 --> 17:05] way.
[17:05 --> 17:06] But it would take a few
[17:06 --> 17:07] years before she could
[17:07 --> 17:08] initiate the marriage
[17:08 --> 17:09] between Nero and Claudia.
[17:09 --> 17:11] Nero was, after all, only
[17:11 --> 17:12] ten at the time and
[17:12 --> 17:13] Claudia was even younger.
[17:15 --> 17:16] But Agrippina could afford
[17:16 --> 17:17] to wait because the
[17:17 --> 17:18] next year she managed to
[17:18 --> 17:19] pull off the trick of
[17:19 --> 17:20] marrying the emperor
[17:20 --> 17:21] himself.
[17:22 --> 17:23] Agrippina, who had been
[17:23 --> 17:24] pig-ponging between
[17:24 --> 17:25] relevance and obscurity
[17:25 --> 17:26] for years, was now
[17:26 --> 17:27] back in power.
[17:29 --> 17:30] But she didn't lose
[17:30 --> 17:31] sight of the ball and
[17:31 --> 17:32] it once began lobbying
[17:32 --> 17:33] Claudius to adopt Nero
[17:33 --> 17:34] and make him an heir.
[17:35 --> 17:37] In 50, Claudius finally
[17:37 --> 17:38] relented and adopted
[17:38 --> 17:39] 13-year-old Lucius
[17:39 --> 17:41] Domitius Ahenabarbis,
[17:41 --> 17:42] at which point the
[17:42 --> 17:43] boy took the name Nero
[17:43 --> 17:44] Claudius Caesar Jerusalem
[17:44 --> 17:45] Germanicus,
[17:45 --> 17:46] shortened for our
[17:46 --> 17:48] purposes to Nero.
[17:49 --> 17:50] Also following in the
[17:50 --> 17:51] footsteps of her great
[17:51 --> 17:52] grandmother, Livia,
[17:53 --> 17:53] Agrippina convinced
[17:53 --> 17:55] Claudius to grant her
[17:55 --> 17:56] the title Augusta and
[17:56 --> 17:57] allow her access to
[17:57 --> 17:58] special carriages that
[17:58 --> 17:59] were generally reserved
[17:59 --> 18:00] for priests.
[18:01 --> 18:02] These special privileges
[18:02 --> 18:03] were outward signs of
[18:03 --> 18:05] the influence Agrippina
[18:05 --> 18:06] held over her uncle
[18:06 --> 18:07] slash husband.
[18:08 --> 18:08] In a particularly
[18:08 --> 18:10] unprecedented display,
[18:10 --> 18:11] Claudius actually named
[18:11 --> 18:12] a veteran's colony he
[18:12 --> 18:14] chartered Agrippina
[18:14 --> 18:15] Nicium, the only
[18:15 --> 18:16] colony in the whole
[18:16 --> 18:17] long history of the
[18:17 --> 18:18] empire to be named
[18:18 --> 18:19] after a woman.
[18:20 --> 18:21] But as important as
[18:21 --> 18:22] it was to Agrippina
[18:22 --> 18:23] that she gather up
[18:23 --> 18:24] as much power as she
[18:24 --> 18:25] could in the near term,
[18:25 --> 18:26] her long term goal
[18:26 --> 18:27] still revolved around
[18:27 --> 18:28] her son.
[18:29 --> 18:30] The 60 plus year old
[18:30 --> 18:31] Claudius was nearing
[18:31 --> 18:32] the end of his life
[18:32 --> 18:33] while the 35 year old
[18:33 --> 18:34] Agrippina still had
[18:34 --> 18:35] a lot of years left.
[18:36 --> 18:37] And that meant making
[18:37 --> 18:38] sure that her son
[18:38 --> 18:39] ascended to the throne
[18:39 --> 18:40] when Claudius died.
[18:43 --> 18:44] The one obvious obstacle
[18:44 --> 18:45] to Agrippina's agenda
[18:45 --> 18:47] was Claudius's natural
[18:47 --> 18:48] son, nine year old
[18:48 --> 18:48] Britannicus.
[18:50 --> 18:51] Although Nero now
[18:51 --> 18:52] had the advantage of
[18:52 --> 18:52] technically being
[18:52 --> 18:54] Claudius's eldest son,
[18:54 --> 18:55] there was no accounting
[18:55 --> 18:56] for the favoritism
[18:56 --> 18:57] Claudius might be
[18:57 --> 18:57] tempted to show
[18:57 --> 18:58] his own offspring.
[18:59 --> 19:01] So, upon becoming
[19:01 --> 19:02] empress, Agrippina
[19:02 --> 19:02] scrubbed the
[19:02 --> 19:04] imperial palace of anyone
[19:04 --> 19:05] who had been connected
[19:05 --> 19:05] to Messalina
[19:05 --> 19:07] and who might be tempted
[19:07 --> 19:07] to advance
[19:07 --> 19:08] Britannicus's interests.
[19:09 --> 19:10] When Claudius cast
[19:10 --> 19:11] about for advice on
[19:11 --> 19:12] what to do about
[19:12 --> 19:13] the issue of succession,
[19:14 --> 19:15] Agrippina wanted to
[19:15 --> 19:16] make sure that the
[19:16 --> 19:16] only people around
[19:16 --> 19:17] to speak up
[19:17 --> 19:18] would be those firmly
[19:18 --> 19:19] in her corner.
[19:20 --> 19:21] She went so far as to
[19:21 --> 19:22] have Britannicus's
[19:22 --> 19:22] tutor killed
[19:22 --> 19:24] when he raised too much
[19:24 --> 19:25] of a stink about his
[19:25 --> 19:26] pupil being neglected
[19:26 --> 19:27] by the emperor.
[19:28 --> 19:29] Unfortunately for Agrippina,
[19:30 --> 19:30] the man who emerged
[19:30 --> 19:32] as one of Britannicus's
[19:32 --> 19:33] greatest advocates
[19:33 --> 19:34] was one of the few men
[19:34 --> 19:35] she could not simply
[19:35 --> 19:36] dispose of on a whim,
[19:37 --> 19:38] Narcissus.
[19:39 --> 19:40] The freedman had his
[19:40 --> 19:41] doubts about Britannicus,
[19:41 --> 19:42] but those paled in
[19:42 --> 19:43] comparisons to his
[19:43 --> 19:44] doubts about Nero.
[19:45 --> 19:46] The boy was shaping up
[19:46 --> 19:47] to be petulant,
[19:47 --> 19:48] selfish, and vain.
[19:49 --> 19:50] When Narcissus looked
[19:50 --> 19:50] at Nero,
[19:51 --> 19:52] he saw the second coming
[19:52 --> 19:52] of Caligula.
[19:54 --> 19:55] Agrippina worked hard
[19:55 --> 19:57] to try to box Narcissus out,
[19:57 --> 19:58] and as I said,
[19:58 --> 19:59] she went after him hard
[19:59 --> 20:00] over the Fusine Lake debacle,
[20:01 --> 20:02] but the freedman was tied
[20:02 --> 20:03] too deeply to the emperor.
[20:04 --> 20:05] Try as she might,
[20:05 --> 20:06] Agrippina could not
[20:06 --> 20:07] dislodge Narcissus
[20:07 --> 20:08] from Claudius's ear.
[20:10 --> 20:11] But despite that,
[20:11 --> 20:13] as was usually the case
[20:13 --> 20:13] during these years,
[20:14 --> 20:15] Agrippina finally did
[20:15 --> 20:15] get her way,
[20:16 --> 20:17] at least partially,
[20:17 --> 20:18] and in 51 AD,
[20:19 --> 20:20] 14-year-old Nero
[20:20 --> 20:21] was elevated to manhood
[20:21 --> 20:23] and named as a co-heir
[20:23 --> 20:24] alongside the still
[20:24 --> 20:25] underage Britannicus.
[20:26 --> 20:27] In theory,
[20:27 --> 20:28] they were meant to rule
[20:28 --> 20:29] together when the time came,
[20:29 --> 20:30] but in practice,
[20:31 --> 20:31] the timing of
[20:31 --> 20:33] Claudius's declaration
[20:33 --> 20:34] opened a window
[20:34 --> 20:34] of a few years
[20:34 --> 20:36] where Nero was now a man
[20:36 --> 20:37] and able to assume
[20:37 --> 20:38] the duties of state,
[20:38 --> 20:39] while Britannicus
[20:39 --> 20:41] was still legally a child.
[20:41 --> 20:42] For all intents and purposes,
[20:42 --> 20:44] Nero, right now,
[20:44 --> 20:45] was the sole heir.
[20:47 --> 20:48] Agrippina would not fail
[20:48 --> 20:49] to miss the significance
[20:49 --> 20:50] of this development.
[20:51 --> 20:52] In 53 AD,
[20:52 --> 20:53] Nero's position
[20:53 --> 20:54] was strengthened even more
[20:54 --> 20:55] by a marriage to his now
[20:55 --> 20:56] stepsister,
[20:56 --> 20:57] Claudia Octavia.
[20:58 --> 20:59] The public was starting
[20:59 --> 21:00] to get behind the idea
[21:00 --> 21:01] that this grandson
[21:01 --> 21:02] of Germanicus
[21:02 --> 21:03] was destined to be
[21:03 --> 21:04] their next emperor.
[21:05 --> 21:06] But just as everything
[21:06 --> 21:07] seemed to be going
[21:07 --> 21:08] Agrippina's way,
[21:08 --> 21:09] Claudius began to regret
[21:09 --> 21:11] having given so much to Nero
[21:11 --> 21:12] at the expense
[21:12 --> 21:13] of his own son.
[21:14 --> 21:15] Whether Narcissus was behind
[21:15 --> 21:16] the change of heart
[21:16 --> 21:17] or whether the emperor
[21:17 --> 21:19] himself came to his own
[21:19 --> 21:20] conclusions is unknown.
[21:21 --> 21:23] But at some point in 54 AD,
[21:23 --> 21:24] Claudius began to look
[21:24 --> 21:25] at Britannicus more and more
[21:25 --> 21:27] as his rightful heir.
[21:28 --> 21:29] Agrippina sensed
[21:29 --> 21:29] that the winds were
[21:29 --> 21:31] beginning to blow against her
[21:31 --> 21:32] and recognized
[21:32 --> 21:33] that she might be facing
[21:33 --> 21:34] a pretty clear deadline.
[21:35 --> 21:36] Britannicus would soon
[21:36 --> 21:37] be coming of age
[21:37 --> 21:38] and once he was
[21:38 --> 21:39] a legal adult,
[21:39 --> 21:41] Claudius was making noise
[21:41 --> 21:42] about no longer
[21:42 --> 21:43] needing his manipulative
[21:43 --> 21:44] wife and her spoiled
[21:44 --> 21:45] teenage son.
[21:46 --> 21:47] With Britannicus slated
[21:47 --> 21:48] to take the rights of
[21:48 --> 21:50] manhood in just six months,
[21:50 --> 21:51] Agrippina had no time
[21:51 --> 21:52] to spare.
[21:52 --> 21:53] She was too close
[21:53 --> 21:54] to fulfilling her dreams
[21:54 --> 21:55] to let it all
[21:55 --> 21:56] just slip away.
[21:57 --> 21:58] Now I am sort of
[21:58 --> 21:59] going with the story here
[21:59 --> 22:01] that Agrippina did indeed
[22:01 --> 22:02] poison Claudius
[22:02 --> 22:03] in October of 54.
[22:04 --> 22:05] But it should be noted
[22:05 --> 22:06] that though the ancient
[22:06 --> 22:07] sources all agree
[22:07 --> 22:08] that she did it,
[22:08 --> 22:09] there was never any
[22:09 --> 22:10] firm evidence they could
[22:10 --> 22:11] point to to prove their case.
[22:12 --> 22:14] The accusation is based
[22:14 --> 22:15] on supposition
[22:15 --> 22:16] and probability
[22:16 --> 22:17] coupled with the old
[22:17 --> 22:19] wicked stepmother motif
[22:19 --> 22:20] that runs through
[22:20 --> 22:21] all of Roman culture.
[22:22 --> 22:24] Basically Agrippina
[22:24 --> 22:25] had the means, motive
[22:25 --> 22:26] and opportunity
[22:26 --> 22:27] and her character
[22:27 --> 22:28] points to her
[22:28 --> 22:29] acting on all three.
[22:30 --> 22:31] The most common version
[22:31 --> 22:32] of the story is that
[22:32 --> 22:33] Agrippina conspired
[22:33 --> 22:34] with Claudius' taster
[22:34 --> 22:36] to slip the emperor
[22:36 --> 22:37] a few poisoned mushrooms,
[22:37 --> 22:38] though his doctor
[22:38 --> 22:39] was also fingered
[22:39 --> 22:40] as a possible culprit.
[22:41 --> 22:43] Whether it really was poison,
[22:43 --> 22:44] which I happen to believe,
[22:45 --> 22:46] or whether it was just
[22:46 --> 22:47] nature taking its course,
[22:47 --> 22:49] Claudius became violently ill
[22:49 --> 22:52] and died on October 13, 54 A.D.
[22:52 --> 22:53] He was 64 years old
[22:53 --> 22:55] and had ruled the empire
[22:55 --> 22:57] for 13 fairly successful years.
[22:59 --> 23:00] The life and career of Claudius
[23:00 --> 23:02] has to be one of the more
[23:02 --> 23:03] unique in all of history.
[23:04 --> 23:05] Good men and bad men,
[23:06 --> 23:06] ambitious men
[23:06 --> 23:08] and unassuming men,
[23:08 --> 23:09] wise men and dumb men
[23:09 --> 23:10] have all taken their
[23:10 --> 23:11] turns in power,
[23:12 --> 23:13] but all wind up conforming
[23:13 --> 23:14] to some kind of
[23:14 --> 23:15] recognizable archetype.
[23:16 --> 23:17] But I can't really think
[23:17 --> 23:18] of anyone who quite resembles
[23:18 --> 23:19] Claudius,
[23:19 --> 23:20] the accidental emperor.
[23:21 --> 23:22] The guy was a punch line
[23:22 --> 23:23] for his whole life.
[23:23 --> 23:24] I doubt there could have been
[23:24 --> 23:25] lower expectations
[23:26 --> 23:26] when it was announced
[23:26 --> 23:28] that Uncle Claudius
[23:28 --> 23:29] was now in charge.
[23:29 --> 23:30] But not only did he clear
[23:30 --> 23:31] the minimal bar
[23:31 --> 23:32] that had been set for him,
[23:33 --> 23:34] but he was far and away
[23:34 --> 23:35] the best emperor
[23:35 --> 23:36] since Augustus himself.
[23:37 --> 23:38] Now I know that isn't
[23:38 --> 23:39] saying very much,
[23:39 --> 23:40] as between the purges
[23:40 --> 23:41] of Tiberius
[23:41 --> 23:41] and well,
[23:42 --> 23:43] the everything of Caligula,
[23:43 --> 23:44] it doesn't take a whole
[23:44 --> 23:45] lot to earn the title
[23:45 --> 23:47] best emperor since Augustus.
[23:47 --> 23:48] But when you think
[23:48 --> 23:49] about the image
[23:49 --> 23:50] most Romans had
[23:50 --> 23:51] in their heads of Claudius,
[23:51 --> 23:52] the slow witted,
[23:52 --> 23:53] stuttering dunce,
[23:53 --> 23:54] you have to admit
[23:54 --> 23:55] that it's impressive
[23:55 --> 23:56] how out of nowhere
[23:56 --> 23:58] he came to claim that prize.
[23:59 --> 24:00] And the thing is,
[24:00 --> 24:02] if you rank all the emperors
[24:02 --> 24:03] past, present and future,
[24:03 --> 24:04] which is a list of somewhere
[24:04 --> 24:05] around 100 men
[24:05 --> 24:06] depending on who's counting,
[24:07 --> 24:08] I think Claudius
[24:08 --> 24:09] pretty comfortably
[24:09 --> 24:10] sits in the top 10.
[24:11 --> 24:12] He's not a great emperor,
[24:12 --> 24:13] like Augustus
[24:13 --> 24:14] or Constantine
[24:14 --> 24:15] or Diocletian,
[24:15 --> 24:17] and he probably sits behind
[24:17 --> 24:17] the so-called
[24:17 --> 24:19] five good emperors
[24:19 --> 24:20] in terms of impact
[24:20 --> 24:20] and talent,
[24:21 --> 24:21] but yeah,
[24:22 --> 24:23] Claudius is in the top 10.
[24:23 --> 24:25] I'm going to miss him.
[24:26 --> 24:27] Next week,
[24:27 --> 24:27] we'll get into
[24:27 --> 24:29] one of the bottom feeders
[24:29 --> 24:30] who is constantly
[24:30 --> 24:30] duking it out
[24:30 --> 24:31] with Caligula
[24:31 --> 24:32] and Elagabalus
[24:32 --> 24:33] and Commodus
[24:33 --> 24:34] for the title
[24:34 --> 24:35] of worst emperor ever.
[24:36 --> 24:37] Though I think Nero
[24:37 --> 24:38] was pretty clearly
[24:38 --> 24:39] not as bad as Caligula
[24:39 --> 24:41] and his leisure pursuits
[24:41 --> 24:42] were far less insane,
[24:42 --> 24:44] he was still pretty awful.
[24:45 --> 24:46] The problem with Nero
[24:46 --> 24:47] is that he didn't seem
[24:47 --> 24:48] to have much interest
[24:48 --> 24:49] in actually being emperor.
[24:49 --> 24:51] He wanted to play gladiator
[24:51 --> 24:52] and sing songs
[24:52 --> 24:53] and compete in games.
[24:54 --> 24:54] To him,
[24:55 --> 24:56] the best part of being emperor
[24:56 --> 24:57] is that everyone
[24:57 --> 24:58] lets you win at everything.
[24:59 --> 25:00] In his defense,
[25:00 --> 25:01] Nero was only
[25:01 --> 25:02] 16 years old
[25:02 --> 25:03] when he ascended to the throne,
[25:04 --> 25:05] which explains a great deal
[25:05 --> 25:06] of his immaturity,
[25:06 --> 25:07] but still,
[25:07 --> 25:08] at a certain point
[25:08 --> 25:09] you've got to look yourself
[25:09 --> 25:09] in the mirror
[25:09 --> 25:11] and want to be a better person.
[25:12 --> 25:13] If not for yourself,
[25:13 --> 25:14] then for the people
[25:14 --> 25:15] who are counting on you
[25:15 --> 25:16] to do a good job.
[25:16 --> 25:18] Because if you don't have
[25:18 --> 25:18] that moment
[25:18 --> 25:19] and you just stay
[25:19 --> 25:20] the same immature kid
[25:20 --> 25:21] your whole life,
[25:21 --> 25:21] well,
[25:22 --> 25:23] eventually you wind up
[25:23 --> 25:24] committing a panicked suicide
[25:24 --> 25:25] after your enemies
[25:25 --> 25:26] have launched
[25:26 --> 25:27] a successful coup d'etat.

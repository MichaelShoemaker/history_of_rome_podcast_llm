[00:41 --> 00:47] military history, The Peloponnesian Wars by Thucydides. Rather than cobbling together
[00:47 --> 00:52] myths and legends, Thucydides used interviews and written records in an attempt to accurately
[00:52 --> 00:57] tell the story of the wars he himself had participated in. It's a fascinating read.
[00:58 --> 01:03] Just remember to go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash Roam so that they know who sent you.
[01:08 --> 01:15] Hello and welcome to the history of Roam. Episode 95, the beginning of the end.
[01:17 --> 01:22] Don't worry about the title of this episode. The transition from Marcus Aurelius to his son
[01:22 --> 01:27] Commodus is usually pointed to as the point at which the luck of the Roman Empire began to run
[01:27 --> 01:33] out. But it has also been joked on more than one occasion that as decline phases go, we should all
[01:33 --> 01:39] be so lucky to enjoy one as long as the Romans did. We are still 300 years from the last Roman
[01:39 --> 01:45] emperor and more than a thousand years from the fall of Constantinople. To put it another way,
[01:45 --> 01:51] the United States has officially been a big S state for about 230 years, which would fit neatly
[01:51 --> 01:57] into the pocket of Rome's quote, decline phase. So for those of you who might fear that we are
[01:57 --> 02:02] nearing the end of our little podcast, don't worry. Focus on the fact that this is merely the beginning
[02:02 --> 02:08] of the end. There's still a lot to cover. The only difference is that rather than talking about what
[02:08 --> 02:13] battles the Romans won and what territory they added to the empire, we'll be talking about what
[02:13 --> 02:19] battles they lost and what territory they abandoned. Something whose end is rapidly
[02:19 --> 02:26] approaching though is Augustus' Principate. Just as the Republic cracked and by necessity gave way
[02:26 --> 02:32] to a new imperial system, so too is the Principate now on the verge of cracking and by necessity
[02:32 --> 02:38] giving way to a new system, which scholars have usually dubbed the Dominate. After the fall of
[02:38 --> 02:44] Commodus, the often troubled Severan dynasty will begin the transition away from the convenient
[02:44 --> 02:49] fictions that the emperor is merely the first citizen and the Senate still maintains its ancient
[02:49 --> 02:56] power to a more authoritarian and more militant political order. When the Severans were toppled,
[02:56 --> 03:01] the crisis period of the mid-third century, roughly analogous to the civil wars of the
[03:01 --> 03:07] first century B.C., finally obliterated the Rome of Augustus and Vespasian and Hadrian,
[03:07 --> 03:12] just as Caesar's civil wars had obliterated the Rome of Camillus and Cato and Cicero.
[03:14 --> 03:19] Rome would surprisingly live through the crisis, but what would come out the other side would be
[03:19 --> 03:25] a very different animal than what went in. The empire would no longer be a quasi-Republican
[03:25 --> 03:31] magisterial dictatorship. Instead, it would be transformed by Aurelian and Diocletian into
[03:31 --> 03:39] a quasi-divine monarchy, almost in the mode of ancient Persia. Commodus then earns the
[03:39 --> 03:44] distinction of being the last true princeps, and since he turned out to be such a disaster,
[03:44 --> 03:48] Marcus Aurelius earns the distinction of being the last good princeps.
[03:49 --> 03:54] Not that Marcus didn't try to ensure that Commodus would be up to the task. He gave the boy a great
[03:54 --> 04:00] education, introduced him to military affairs, and took him along on his one extended tour of
[04:00 --> 04:07] the empire, but in the end it seems that Commodus just wasn't having it. He was growing into a man
[04:07 --> 04:12] far more in the mold of his uncle Lucius Verus than in the mold of his father, so much so that
[04:12 --> 04:17] it was an accepted fact in Rome that Commodus was not actually Marcus's son at all, and that
[04:17 --> 04:24] he was in fact the product of an affair between Faustina and a gladiator. Commodus loved games
[04:24 --> 04:30] and gambling and spectacle and partying, all the things his father utterly disdained.
[04:31 --> 04:36] Setting aside any psychoanalytical reasons for Commodus turning out to be the exact
[04:36 --> 04:40] opposite of his father, the boy did face a considerable uphill battle on the road to
[04:40 --> 04:48] becoming a conscientious, serious, and virtuous man. He was, after all, the first emperor who was
[04:48 --> 04:55] born to the purple, as they say. Surprising as it is, thus far, not a single Roman emperor was
[04:55 --> 05:03] himself born to an emperor. Not Augustus, or Tiberius, or Caligula, or Claudius, or Nero,
[05:03 --> 05:10] or Galba, or Otho, or Vitellius, or Vespasian, or Titus, or Domitian, or Nerva, or Trajan,
[05:10 --> 05:17] or Hadrian, or Marcus Aurelius. Only Titus and Domitian were even the blood sons of an emperor,
[05:17 --> 05:21] and they spent their formative years as the obscure sons of a minor politician in general.
[05:22 --> 05:28] But Commodus was born shortly after Marcus became emperor, and was thus raised in the palace as true
[05:28 --> 05:35] Roman royalty, surrounded by all the pleasures indulgent sycophants could drum up. Much as the
[05:35 --> 05:40] austere Marcus did his best to mold Commodus in his own image, he stood little chance against
[05:40 --> 05:47] the spoiling atmosphere that crown princes are often submerged in. Marcus could see what was
[05:47 --> 05:53] happening, and openly worried that he was raising another Nero. But for all his stoic wisdom, he
[05:53 --> 05:58] fell victim to the realities of fraternal love, and when he wasn't maintaining a strict regimen
[05:58 --> 06:04] of denial, he was rationalizing away his son's behavior. After all, hadn't Philip II been
[06:04 --> 06:09] mortified at how Alexander the Great was turning out? And he turned out to be Alexander the Great.
[06:10 --> 06:14] So there's no reason to believe Commodus won't turn it around once he matures a bit.
[06:16 --> 06:20] People have often wondered, though, why Marcus of all people would break with the imperial
[06:20 --> 06:25] tradition of adopting a worthy heir, and instead choose to hand it all over to a son,
[06:25 --> 06:30] who was pretty clearly a bad egg, and who was pretty clearly not going to mature into Alexander
[06:30 --> 06:36] the Great one day. The answer involves some speculation on our part, but in the first case,
[06:36 --> 06:42] we should never forget that the reason why every previous Roman emperor had adopted an heir was
[06:42 --> 06:48] because there were simply very few blood sons to be had. There were in fact only two emperors who
[06:48 --> 06:54] died with living sons, Vespasian, who left the throne to Titus, and Claudius, who had wanted to
[06:54 --> 06:59] leave the throne to Britannicus, but was manipulated into adopting Nero instead.
[07:00 --> 07:06] For every other emperor, heir adoption was not an explicit policy or even a preferred mode of
[07:06 --> 07:12] succession. It was the result of inescapable circumstance. Augustus tried like mad to get
[07:12 --> 07:18] anyone with a blood connection to him in power, but was forced by fate to roll with Tiberius instead.
[07:20 --> 07:24] Beyond the simple fact that just about every emperor probably would have left the throne
[07:24 --> 07:30] to his son had they had the chance, the further fact is that not letting Commodus succeed him
[07:30 --> 07:37] brought with it its own problems. In his recent biography of Marcus Aurelius, Frank McLenn talks
[07:37 --> 07:43] about Marcus's quandary at length after relaying Septimius Severus's quote that Marcus's great
[07:43 --> 07:50] mistake was not killing the rotten Commodus when he had the chance. In McLenn's formulation,
[07:50 --> 07:56] Marcus was faced with a stark choice. Either he had to kill Commodus or promote him. There was no
[07:56 --> 08:03] middle ground. When, for what I hope are easy to understand reasons, Marcus did not assassinate his
[08:03 --> 08:09] own son, he had no choice then but to make him emperor. The alternative would have been to leave
[08:09 --> 08:16] the empire with all the ingredients for a civil war. There would naturally be, either out of
[08:16 --> 08:22] jealousy, spite, or stifled ambition, those opposed to whoever Marcus decided to adopt in Commodus's
[08:22 --> 08:28] place. Those disgruntled elements would likely, as we have seen in other times and places,
[08:28 --> 08:33] rally around the overlooked crown prince, whispering in his ear that it was outrageous
[08:33 --> 08:40] and unjust that his birthright had been stolen by some usurper. And then, voila, civil war.
[08:41 --> 08:47] Had Marcus left Commodus both alive and out of power, we might be talking about that decision
[08:47 --> 08:52] as one of the great blunders in history. And the alternative left to Marcus,
[08:52 --> 08:55] the not blunder choice, as it were, meant killing his own son.
[08:56 --> 08:59] Are we really supposed to fault him for not going down that road?
[09:01 --> 09:07] Marcus and Commodus arrived back in Rome in late 176 and the emperor quickly set about promoting
[09:07 --> 09:14] his son politically. The emperor had already granted his son the title Germanicus in recognition
[09:14 --> 09:19] of, oh, I guess the fact that he had been physically present at the front. And now,
[09:19 --> 09:23] upon their return to the capital, Marcus shared his triumphal parade with the young man,
[09:23 --> 09:28] and they stood side by side in a gleaming chariot as the procession made its way through the city.
[09:30 --> 09:34] Probably coinciding with the triumph, though the chronology is a bit hazy,
[09:34 --> 09:39] Marcus commissioned his own triumphal column, an intricate spiral relief monument,
[09:39 --> 09:44] to rival that of Trajan's, telling the story of Marcus' victories along the Danube.
[09:45 --> 09:50] The column still stands today, and as I hinted, it is one of the key pieces of evidence we have
[09:50 --> 09:55] for putting together a narrative of the Marcomannic Wars. The depiction of the
[09:55 --> 10:01] Reign Miracle is perhaps the most famous panel, but the section usefully depicting a proto-democratic
[10:01 --> 10:06] German council of war is also often pointed to by anthropologists of early German history.
[10:07 --> 10:11] As the column winds its way up, and the momentum of war shifts away from the Germans,
[10:11 --> 10:17] we are treated to multiple depictions of a larger-than-life Marcus overseeing prisoners,
[10:17 --> 10:23] beheadings, and wailing families. Today, these panels act as a sort of Rorschach test for the
[10:23 --> 10:28] viewer, with some claiming to see Marcus playing the part of merciful conqueror offering clemency
[10:28 --> 10:34] to the captured, while others see stoic Marcus playing the part of harsh realist and ordering
[10:34 --> 10:40] the executions to proceed. The History of Rome has posted a few of the more famous scenes from
[10:40 --> 10:46] the column on the blog at thehistoryofrome.tipad.com and invites you to offer your own interpretation.
[10:48 --> 10:55] 177 opened with Commodus elevated to an ordinary consulship. A consulship of particular note,
[10:55 --> 11:01] not for anything Commodus did while in office, but because, at 15, he was the youngest consul
[11:01 --> 11:08] in the history of the empire. Just as Hadrian had set a precedent whereby the rules would not
[11:08 --> 11:14] apply to Marcus, Marcus himself followed the same line with Commodus. For those of you wondering
[11:14 --> 11:19] who received the honor of serving as the future emperor's colleague, it was a nephew of Lucius
[11:19 --> 11:25] Verus named Plautius Quintillus, who was now married to one of Marcus' daughters. Quintillus
[11:25 --> 11:30] would eventually serve as an advisor to the emperor Commodus, and after being ignored in
[11:30 --> 11:33] the succession battles that followed his brother-in-law's death, he would wind up
[11:33 --> 11:38] committing suicide in 205 to escape execution at the hands of Septimius Severus.
[11:41 --> 11:45] The peaceful lull that the empire had enjoyed following first the accession of hostilities
[11:45 --> 11:51] along the Danube and then the abrupt end to Cassius' revolt in the east proved to be just that,
[11:51 --> 11:58] a lull, later that year. When spring arrived, the Quadi took advantage of the emperor's withdrawal
[11:58 --> 12:04] from the north and began attacking Roman positions across the frontier. They were soon joined by the
[12:04 --> 12:11] Marcomani, and once again the northern border was awash in bloody skirmishes. Marcus hoped his
[12:11 --> 12:15] presence would not be required and that the generals he left behind would be able to bottle
[12:15 --> 12:20] up the menace as he remained in Rome to focus on administrative work and the all-important task
[12:20 --> 12:29] of establishing his son's legacy. In the summer of 177, Commodus was given the title Augustus,
[12:29 --> 12:35] and with the honorific, the now probably 16-year-old boy found himself elevated to the same level of
[12:35 --> 12:42] power Lucius Verus had enjoyed. Technically, father and son were now co-emperors. Coins from
[12:42 --> 12:47] this period go out of their way to establish the notion of their joint and unified rule,
[12:47 --> 12:51] but as with Lucius, Marcus was still in every way the senior Augusti.
[12:53 --> 12:58] Despite Marcus' hopes, the situation in Germania was refusing to solve itself.
[12:59 --> 13:04] The Germans had learned from the last round of fighting and this time refused to offer formal
[13:04 --> 13:09] battles to the legions, choosing instead to use guerrilla tactics to harass the Romans.
[13:11 --> 13:16] As is typical of most asymmetrical wars, whenever the Romans were able to force a battle,
[13:16 --> 13:21] they usually won, but these brief moments of triumph could do little to stop the neverending
[13:21 --> 13:28] series of demoralizing raids and ambushes and traps that kept the legions harried and skittish.
[13:29 --> 13:35] The situation was quickly spiraling out of control and after resisting calls for his presence,
[13:35 --> 13:40] Marcus finally relented and in 178 began making preparations to return to the front.
[13:40 --> 13:48] His final bit of business before leaving was to hastily marry Commodus to Brudia Crispina, daughter
[13:48 --> 13:52] of a family distinguished mostly for their close connection to the imperial household.
[13:53 --> 13:59] At the age of 56, the always on the frail side Marcus had no way of knowing how much more
[13:59 --> 14:04] campaigning his body would be able to handle, but when he and Commodus left Rome in the summer of
[14:04 --> 14:10] 178, Marcus was content in the knowledge that his son was now recognized by everyone as Augustus
[14:10 --> 14:14] and that he was properly married and ready to carry on the imperial line.
[14:15 --> 14:21] The emperor's foresight would be rewarded, if you can call Commodus' unchallenged ascension a reward,
[14:22 --> 14:25] because when he left Rome this time, it would be for the last time.
[14:26 --> 14:32] In less than two years, Marcus would be dead and just as he had arranged, Commodus would face no
[14:32 --> 14:40] opposition as he assumed the mantle of sole emperor. Arriving at the front, Marcus renewed
[14:40 --> 14:46] his surprisingly useful alliance with the Aziges, going so far as to allow them passage through
[14:46 --> 14:50] Dacia so they could travel to and from their traditional homelands, and then set himself
[14:50 --> 14:56] to the task of purging the Marco Mani and the Quadi of their hostile tendencies once and for all.
[14:56 --> 15:03] As the emperor began to think about how best to accomplish his goal, he started dreaming bigger
[15:03 --> 15:07] dreams than the simple strategy of maintaining Hadrian's borders had previously allowed him.
[15:09 --> 15:14] Liberating himself from Hadrian's cowardice or prudence or whatever you want to call it,
[15:14 --> 15:20] Marcus began to sketch out a plan to annex one or possibly even two new provinces into the empire,
[15:21 --> 15:27] internally dubbed Marcomania and Sarmatia. Together, they would have encompassed most
[15:27 --> 15:33] of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and pushed the northern border of the empire into modern Bavaria.
[15:34 --> 15:39] Scholars had long pointed out that the scheme was ludicrous, and as a result,
[15:39 --> 15:43] doubt the credulity of sources claiming that wise Marcus could have considered such an
[15:43 --> 15:50] indefensible plan, but the patience of the emperor had apparently run out,
[15:50 --> 15:54] and he seems to have just wanted to swallow the entire territory into the empire so it could be
[15:54 --> 15:59] rationally policed and taxed rather than being allowed to continue on as a breeding ground for
[15:59 --> 16:08] strife and chaos. With the Ezigis safely in his corner, Marcus ordered 40,000 soldiers across
[16:08 --> 16:14] the Danube, and the process of conquest was initiated. The Marco Mani and Quadi refused
[16:14 --> 16:19] to offer themselves in battle and continued their guerrilla campaign, so the Romans methodically
[16:19 --> 16:25] worked to sweep and hold every last piece of land until the German armies had nowhere else to hide.
[16:27 --> 16:31] This being no ordinary foreign excursion, the legions began to build stone forts
[16:31 --> 16:38] rather than keeping to their mobile camps. In the late summer, the Romans were able to trap and
[16:38 --> 16:44] defeat a mid-sized tribe allied with the Marco Mani. The captured Germans were marched into
[16:44 --> 16:49] lower Pannonia where they were disarmed and settled. If this doesn't seem like the worst
[16:49 --> 16:55] punishment in the world, you're right. Other than the shame of being defeated and dislodged
[16:55 --> 17:00] from their traditional homeland, being moved into the empire with its promise of eventual citizenship
[17:00 --> 17:06] was a pretty good deal. The settlement reminds us of the toll the Antonine Plague had taken on the
[17:06 --> 17:13] empire. The border provinces had become depopulated to the point that as often as the emperor was
[17:13 --> 17:18] looking to destroy the tribes, he was also trying to figure out ways to resettle them peacefully on
[17:18 --> 17:24] Roman land so that they would become industrious new taxpayers. Indeed, as we'll see in a minute
[17:24 --> 17:30] with the Quadi, Marcus' genocidal bent seems to have given way to a policy of integration.
[17:30 --> 17:34] He no longer wanted to exterminate the Germans, he wanted to make them Romans.
[17:37 --> 17:43] By the winter of 178-179, the Quadi began to worry that the territorial squeeze Marcus
[17:43 --> 17:48] had ordered was having an effect. Not only were there fewer places to hide, but there was almost
[17:48 --> 17:55] no land to be fought over anymore. In response to the inevitable Roman conquest, the Quadi decided
[17:55 --> 18:00] to just abandon the fight and migrate north where they could make a new life free of Roman troubles.
[18:01 --> 18:07] But though this seems like the sort of thing Marcus would have welcomed, after all, the Quadi were
[18:07 --> 18:14] essentially ceding him this vast swath of new territory, so awesome, right? The emperor instead
[18:14 --> 18:18] ordered an army led by Maximianus to head the Quadi off and prevent their escape.
[18:20 --> 18:25] Had the empire been bursting at the population seams with thousands upon thousands of potential
[18:25 --> 18:30] settlers ready and willing to colonize some new territory, Marcus probably would have just let
[18:30 --> 18:36] the Quadi go. But Rome was enduring the opposite plight. In the hardest hit areas, the plague had
[18:36 --> 18:42] cost the empire something like 30 percent of its citizens. Not only was there no excess population
[18:42 --> 18:48] to be had, Marcus was trying to fill the empty quarters with German settlers. So if he just let
[18:48 --> 18:55] the Quadi walk away, his new provinces would remain empty and unproductive and not paying taxes.
[18:57 --> 19:02] Maximianus succeeded in preventing the Quadi from escaping and in doing so,
[19:02 --> 19:05] set the stage for the last great battle of the Germanic Wars.
[19:06 --> 19:11] The Quadi were trapped and desperate, the Marcomani just saw their own Roman dominated
[19:11 --> 19:17] future pass before their eyes, and a third tribe, the Roxolani, were spoiling for a fight
[19:17 --> 19:21] because they were bitter at having been denied all the favorable concessions their cousins,
[19:21 --> 19:27] the Aziges, had won. Together, they determined that the guerrilla campaign was futile and that
[19:27 --> 19:34] they needed a decisive victory to prevent complete Roman envelopment. In April 179,
[19:34 --> 19:40] a combined German army faced off against the legions and were utterly routed. The back of
[19:40 --> 19:47] German resistance broken, once again, Marcus stood on the cusp of total victory. A few mop-up
[19:47 --> 19:52] operations were all that stood between the emperor and his new province of Marcomania.
[19:52 --> 19:59] But once again, fate stepped in to deny Marcus a final crowning glory.
[20:01 --> 20:07] While still encamped along the Danube, Marcus contracted the Antonine Plague in early 180 AD
[20:07 --> 20:13] and was forced to his deathbed. Knowing that the end was near, he refused to linger on as a
[20:13 --> 20:19] shell of a man, or, more importantly, as a shell of an emperor, and stopped eating or drinking,
[20:19 --> 20:24] content to let death release him from all the mortal burdens he had spent a lifetime attempting
[20:24 --> 20:32] to bear. He implored Commodus to complete the job on the Danube, but his son, who did his best to
[20:32 --> 20:37] stay away from his dying and likely contagious father at the end, was already beginning to
[20:37 --> 20:42] indulge in his own fantasies about what was good and bad for the empire and what was good and bad
[20:42 --> 20:49] for Commodus. In mid-March, Marcus gathered his corps of advisors and generals, a corps who had
[20:49 --> 20:54] proved during these troubled decades to be amongst the most capable men in Roman history,
[20:54 --> 20:59] and implored them to guide Commodus and give the boy the benefit of their experience and wisdom.
[21:01 --> 21:08] Having done all he could do, Marcus died on March 17, 180 AD. He was 59 years old
[21:08 --> 21:13] and had been sometimes emperor and sometimes co-emperor for almost exactly 19 years.
[21:15 --> 21:19] His death will mark a turning point in Roman history, or at least a turning point in the way
[21:19 --> 21:24] we conceive of and tell the story of Roman history. There would be no sixth good emperor.
[21:25 --> 21:29] The glory and power that was Rome in the second century would quickly give way to the
[21:29 --> 21:35] chaos and destruction that was Rome in the third century. Though we conveniently point to Commodus
[21:35 --> 21:39] as providing some crucial element in the transition from good to bad, from rise to
[21:39 --> 21:44] fall, the fact is that most of the seeds that eventually grew into the crisis of the third
[21:44 --> 21:50] century had taken root during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. Commodus may have acted as some kind of
[21:50 --> 21:56] supercharged fertilizer, but it's not like he took an empire at its swing and best and single-handedly
[21:56 --> 22:02] destroyed all that was good in the world. First of all, the migration of the barbarian tribes
[22:02 --> 22:08] beyond the northern frontier, specifically the rise of an interconnected and sometimes ill-defined
[22:08 --> 22:13] people called the Goths, was already putting pressure on the borders in ways never before felt.
[22:14 --> 22:19] From the reign of Marcus on, the western empire would find itself under near constant attack from
[22:19 --> 22:25] these barbarian forces who were looking to raid the empire or settle within the empire or conquer
[22:25 --> 22:31] the empire. In the past, the unified and disciplined legions had always been able to easily mow down the
[22:31 --> 22:37] proud but undisciplined warriors of the north, but a new breed of horde was coming, one that was
[22:37 --> 22:42] often led by men who had fought in the legions and who knew how to fight the Roman way, which
[22:42 --> 22:47] meant that the Romans were about to lose the one competitive advantage they had always had.
[22:49 --> 22:53] Further, the Antonine Plague had sapped the strength of both the legions and the civilian
[22:53 --> 22:59] population, reducing the Roman ranks at every level. Senators were dying, farmers were dying,
[22:59 --> 23:06] generals were dying, infantrymen were dying, emperors were dying, food shortages resulted,
[23:06 --> 23:12] reduced tax revenue resulted, and thus an increased tax burden on those still alive resulted,
[23:12 --> 23:17] and of course the crippling of Rome's military strength resulted. The problem of manning,
[23:17 --> 23:22] feeding, and paying the armies would lead to a disconnect between the interests of the people
[23:22 --> 23:27] of Rome and the interests of its armies, which in turn led to the more fully developed military
[23:27 --> 23:35] dictatorship of the Severan dynasty. Finally, the brief revolt of Ovidius Cassius hinted that the
[23:35 --> 23:40] unity between the eastern and western halves of the empire was beginning to crack. When all is
[23:40 --> 23:45] well, everyone loves everyone else. When times get tough, everyone begins to look at everyone
[23:45 --> 23:51] else as the cause of their misfortune. For those in the east, the western battles against migrating
[23:51 --> 23:57] barbarians was a drain on their resources, financial as well as human, and for those in
[23:57 --> 24:02] the west, the east had become practically an alien world inhabited by scheming eunuchs and
[24:02 --> 24:10] oriental mystics who were destroying the moral fiber of the empire. It is fair to say that
[24:10 --> 24:15] Commodus did not cause any of this, nor did he cause the decline and fall of the Roman empire.
[24:15 --> 24:22] Next week, though, we will see what Commodus did to exacerbate the situation. Because though he got
[24:22 --> 24:27] off to a good start, a botched assassination attempt early in his reign would trigger an
[24:27 --> 24:33] excess of paranoia, a paranoia the young emperor would offset by retreating into a megalomaniacal
[24:33 --> 24:37] fantasy world.

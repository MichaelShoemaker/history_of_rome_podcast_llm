[00:00 --> 00:13] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 98, Purchasing Power.
[00:13 --> 00:18] After numerous failed attempts, foiled plots, and exposed conspiracies, someone finally
[00:18 --> 00:21] managed to kill Commodus.
[00:21 --> 00:25] That someone was a young athlete named Narcissus, who had been promised a huge reward by the
[00:25 --> 00:31] emperor's inner circle if he successfully strangled Commodus to death.
[00:31 --> 00:36] With the deed done and finally done right, phase two of the plan was then initiated.
[00:36 --> 00:41] One of the key conspirators, Praetorian prefect Quintus Letus, went and retrieved Publius
[00:41 --> 00:46] Helvius Pertinax, who had been pacing around his house all night, waiting for either the
[00:46 --> 00:51] good news that the emperor was dead, or the bad news that the plot had failed and it was
[00:51 --> 00:55] caught up in the never-ending cycle of purges.
[00:55 --> 00:59] When the knock on the door finally came, it was Letus announcing that the emperor was
[00:59 --> 01:02] in fact dead, and phase two was at hand.
[01:02 --> 01:07] Phase two was hustling Pertinax to the Praetorian camp, where Letus had arranged for the old
[01:07 --> 01:11] senator to be immediately proclaimed emperor.
[01:11 --> 01:15] The troops were told that Commodus had died of an embolism, that Pertinax was already
[01:15 --> 01:20] the consensus choice to succeed him, and that it was up to the rank and file Praetorians
[01:20 --> 01:22] to make it official.
[01:22 --> 01:26] They were uneasy about all of this, and were probably one of the few groups in the empire
[01:26 --> 01:31] ready to shed tears for Commodus, but Letus promised them the world if they backed Pertinax,
[01:31 --> 01:34] and so they did.
[01:34 --> 01:38] The point of all of this was to present the senate with a fait accompli, so that when
[01:38 --> 01:42] the senators awakened on New Year's Day and found the old emperor dead, a new one would
[01:42 --> 01:45] already be in place.
[01:45 --> 01:50] All night, the conspirators fretted over how the senate would react, but they were worried
[01:50 --> 01:51] over nothing.
[01:51 --> 01:56] Most of the senate, after finally being convinced that this wasn't one of the hilarious emperor's
[01:56 --> 02:01] practical jokes, were thrilled at the news that mad as a hatter Commodus was dead, and
[02:01 --> 02:06] that Pertinax, wise, capable, and experienced Pertinax, was the man the Praetorians were
[02:06 --> 02:09] demanding they accept as the new emperor.
[02:09 --> 02:14] The choice of Pertinax was ratified immediately, and in almost the same breath, the memory
[02:14 --> 02:17] of Commodus was officially damned.
[02:17 --> 02:21] All his crazy pronouncements about renaming Rome, and the months, and the legions, those
[02:21 --> 02:26] were all nullified, and across the city, his statues were toppled.
[02:26 --> 02:31] At the dawn of a new year, a new day was dawning for the empire.
[02:31 --> 02:32] Kind of.
[02:32 --> 02:33] Sort of.
[02:33 --> 02:36] Not really.
[02:36 --> 02:40] So a few episodes ago, I just sort of slipped Pertinax into the narrative, and have referred
[02:40 --> 02:46] to him off and on ever since, but other than the fact that he was an able military officer,
[02:46 --> 02:50] and that he did his damnedest not to get involved in plots against Commodus, I haven't
[02:50 --> 02:53] really told you that much about him.
[02:53 --> 02:57] By far the most interesting thing to note is that, unique among emperors, at least up
[02:57 --> 03:02] until this point, he was the son of a mere freedman.
[03:02 --> 03:07] Born in 126, he had planned on becoming a grammar instructor, but in his late teens,
[03:07 --> 03:10] he decided to have some strings pulled for him so he could be commissioned as an officer
[03:10 --> 03:14] in the legions instead.
[03:14 --> 03:18] Once in uniform, he immediately proved that he was a hardworking soldier and a natural
[03:18 --> 03:23] leader of men, whatever his lowly background said about him.
[03:23 --> 03:27] He came to the attention of Claudius Pompeianus, who was himself of lowly origin, though not
[03:27 --> 03:33] as lowly as being the son of a freedman, and he became attached to the older man's staff.
[03:33 --> 03:38] As Pompeianus' star rose during the reign of Marcus Aurelius, Pertinax rose along with
[03:38 --> 03:39] it.
[03:40 --> 03:44] Eventually, his undeniable talent won out and Marcus decided to enroll the young man
[03:44 --> 03:49] as a senator so he could grant Pertinax a full command.
[03:49 --> 03:55] In 175, he was granted a suffet consulship as a reward for his excellent service, a consulship
[03:55 --> 04:01] he would coincidentally share with Didius Julianus, who we will get to in a second.
[04:01 --> 04:05] His rise was not without setbacks, though, and for his entire career he would have to
[04:05 --> 04:10] deal with aristocratic bigotry against this son of a slave who had had the temerity to
[04:10 --> 04:14] order around his social betters.
[04:14 --> 04:18] During the reign of Marcus, he was briefly blacklisted following the machinations of
[04:18 --> 04:23] some officials close to Faustina, who hated Pertinax for, among other things, his close
[04:23 --> 04:27] relationship with Pompeianus, who she detested.
[04:27 --> 04:32] During the early years of Commodus' reign, Pertinax essentially retired from public life
[04:32 --> 04:36] rather than attempt to get into a political flame war with Perenus, but once Perenus was
[04:36 --> 04:43] out of the picture, Pertinax found himself back in favor and back in demand.
[04:43 --> 04:47] In all, during his long career, he served with distinction in the Parthian War and the
[04:47 --> 04:52] Marcomannic Wars and at one time or another governed the provinces of Upper Moesia, Lower
[04:52 --> 04:57] Moesia, Dacia, Syria, Britain, and Africa.
[04:57 --> 05:02] Far from being honorary postings, these were among the most critical territories the Empire
[05:02 --> 05:05] had to offer.
[05:05 --> 05:09] Throughout his career, there was only one real lingering flaw in his character, at least
[05:09 --> 05:13] according to the troops who served under him.
[05:13 --> 05:17] Unlike many other commanders, particularly those who served at Commodus' pleasure,
[05:17 --> 05:20] Pertinax was not indulgent of his troops.
[05:20 --> 05:25] He demanded strict discipline in the camps and had no time for whiners or complainers.
[05:25 --> 05:27] They were soldiers and they ought to act like it.
[05:27 --> 05:31] There was nothing more to say on the subject.
[05:31 --> 05:35] Unfortunately this reputation would come back to haunt him once he was Emperor.
[05:35 --> 05:39] Strict discipline was not, for example, what the Praetorian Guard had in mind when they
[05:39 --> 05:47] went and did the old man a pretty huge favor by making him Emperor of the whole Empire.
[05:47 --> 05:51] While the Senate needed no prodding to be ecstatic about the elevation of Pertinax,
[05:51 --> 05:54] the Praetorians had to be bought off.
[05:54 --> 05:58] In securing their support, Pertinax had been forced to promise a huge donative to every
[05:58 --> 06:01] man in the Guard.
[06:01 --> 06:05] Now more than ever, the men of the Imperial bodyguard didn't care who was in power as
[06:05 --> 06:07] long as they got paid.
[06:07 --> 06:12] In a few short months, the crass financial underpinnings of their morality would be displayed
[06:12 --> 06:15] in a way never before imaginable.
[06:15 --> 06:19] But for now, they accepted the promise of money from Pertinax and so they supported
[06:19 --> 06:20] Pertinax.
[06:21 --> 06:26] Out in the provinces, word spread of Commodus' demise, and though there was no political
[06:26 --> 06:31] unrest following the death of the erratic and dangerous Emperor, the fact of his murder
[06:31 --> 06:36] and the fact that a man who had no connection whatsoever to the now-dead Antonine dynasty
[06:36 --> 06:40] had to have sparked the imaginations of more than a few powerful Governors.
[06:40 --> 06:46] Shortly, we will deal with three such powerful Governors, who between them commanded a majority
[06:46 --> 06:49] of the Empire's legions.
[06:49 --> 06:53] They all knew and appreciated the service and stature of Pertinax, and so there was
[06:53 --> 06:55] no immediate uprising.
[06:55 --> 07:00] The new Emperor was awfully long in the tooth, and when he went to meet his maker, who exactly
[07:00 --> 07:06] would succeed him, was the question on all their minds.
[07:06 --> 07:08] The answer came much sooner than anyone thought.
[07:08 --> 07:13] You see, when Pertinax promised a huge bonus to the Praetorians in exchange for their support,
[07:13 --> 07:19] he had done so at the behest of Letus, who told him it was the only way.
[07:19 --> 07:23] Once the crisis of succession was in the rear-view mirror a bit, though, Pertinax re-evaluated
[07:23 --> 07:28] the wisdom of paying the Praetorians such an ungodly sum of money.
[07:28 --> 07:32] He came through with half the amount, but declined to pay the rest, arguing that what
[07:32 --> 07:36] he had already given them was more than most soldiers make in a lifetime.
[07:36 --> 07:42] Besides, the Imperial treasury is empty, so there's really nothing left to pay you with.
[07:42 --> 07:46] But the Praetorians couldn't have cared less about where the money came from or what the
[07:46 --> 07:48] average soldier made in a lifetime.
[07:48 --> 07:52] They just wanted what was theirs.
[07:52 --> 07:55] Pertinax considered the matter closed, though, and shifted his focus to seeing what could
[07:55 --> 08:00] be done to get the Empire back on track after so many years of mismanagement.
[08:00 --> 08:04] The Praetorians, however, did not consider the matter closed.
[08:04 --> 08:07] They were the only reason this stuffy old man was on the throne in the first place,
[08:07 --> 08:10] and now he was stiffing them when the bill came due?
[08:10 --> 08:12] Who did he think he was?
[08:12 --> 08:17] They made him, and they could break him.
[08:17 --> 08:22] In March, Pertinax visited the port of Ostia to inspect incoming grain shipments, and while
[08:22 --> 08:26] there, he was given evidence proving that one of the year's consuls, a senator named
[08:26 --> 08:32] Quintus Falco, had gone in with a few key members of the Guard on a plot to kill Pertinax.
[08:32 --> 08:38] The Guard promised to make Falco Emperor if he promised to pay up promptly and in full.
[08:38 --> 08:42] Unwilling to be held hostage by a bunch of greedy bodyguards who did not know their true
[08:43 --> 08:48] Pertinax continued to refuse them the second half of the donative, but now did so knowing
[08:48 --> 08:53] full well that he was putting himself in a very dangerous position.
[08:53 --> 08:58] But whether out of principle, obstinacy, or something else, he refused to back down on
[08:58 --> 09:00] the issue.
[09:00 --> 09:05] He went so far as to avoid passing out Imperial titles to his wife and children, perhaps
[09:05 --> 09:10] suspecting that if and when a final showdown came that they would be safer on the sidelines
[09:10 --> 09:16] than carrying around dangerous titles like Augusta and Caesar.
[09:16 --> 09:20] There was a hope prevailing in Rome early in 193 that maybe the reign of Commodus had
[09:20 --> 09:25] just been a hiccup, and that with Pertinax now in power, that things could go back to
[09:25 --> 09:27] normal.
[09:27 --> 09:32] Commodus aside, no one living had any memory of a bad emperor.
[09:32 --> 09:37] Even the oldest of the old men had been born during the reign of Trajan.
[09:37 --> 09:42] Pertinax himself, a venerable elder statesman, had been born during the reign of Hadrian.
[09:42 --> 09:47] The point is that for most Romans, the default setting was good emperors reigning for a long
[09:47 --> 09:52] time over a relatively quiet and stable empire.
[09:52 --> 09:56] So the reasoning went that since Pertinax was obviously not a crazy person, that maybe
[09:56 --> 10:02] the detour through Commodus would prove to be just that, a detour.
[10:02 --> 10:06] Pertinax would reign for a bit, then hand power to some worthy successor, and then he
[10:06 --> 10:11] would pass power to some other worthy successor, and just like that, the memory of Commodus,
[10:11 --> 10:15] already damned, would be truly forgotten.
[10:15 --> 10:17] But it was not to be.
[10:17 --> 10:19] Commodus was not a detour.
[10:19 --> 10:22] He was the new way forward.
[10:22 --> 10:26] The Romans would never again return to the road they had traveled for the last century,
[10:26 --> 10:30] the one paved in wisdom, luck, and competence.
[10:30 --> 10:33] No, they were on a different road now.
[10:33 --> 10:38] And in late March 193, the people of Rome discovered how far they had already strayed
[10:38 --> 10:45] from that good solid road they had enjoyed for so many years.
[10:45 --> 10:49] The Praetorians had been indulged for too long to simply take Pertinax's stiffing lying
[10:49 --> 10:50] down.
[10:50 --> 10:54] Well, it wasn't just the case of the missing Donative.
[10:54 --> 10:58] It was also the fact that Pertinax was trying to impose a level of discipline on the urban
[10:58 --> 11:01] troops that they were totally unaccustomed to.
[11:01 --> 11:02] What were they?
[11:02 --> 11:03] Infantry?
[11:03 --> 11:08] They had never been hip to Pertinax to begin with, but Letus had been persuasive on the
[11:08 --> 11:14] night of Commodus's death, which they had always suspected had been murder, not an embolism,
[11:14 --> 11:17] and so they had gone along with their prefect.
[11:17 --> 11:22] But if the past few months had proved anything, it was that this relationship just wasn't
[11:22 --> 11:23] going to work.
[11:23 --> 11:29] It was time for the Praetorians to break up with Pertinax.
[11:29 --> 11:34] On March 28, a collection of about 300 soldiers and officers of the guard stormed the palace
[11:34 --> 11:36] to confront the emperor.
[11:36 --> 11:41] None of the soldiers or officials surrounding Pertinax had any desire to get in the middle
[11:41 --> 11:45] of what was about to go down, so this armed company of Praetorians was allowed to pass
[11:45 --> 11:46] unchallenged.
[11:46 --> 11:50] Well, not totally unchallenged.
[11:50 --> 11:54] Pertinax heard the commotion and dispatched Letus to go talk his men down.
[11:54 --> 11:58] But when Letus, not exactly the most scrupulous guy in the world, confronted the incoming
[11:58 --> 12:04] troops, he decided that joining them would be safer than trying to stop them.
[12:04 --> 12:09] So he promptly about-faced and led his men straight to the emperor.
[12:09 --> 12:15] Pertinax faced down the 300 Praetorians, well, 301 I guess at this point, and attempted to
[12:15 --> 12:20] explain his position and reasonably defuse the situation.
[12:20 --> 12:24] Whether or not his words were starting to dissuade a majority of the men became irrelevant
[12:24 --> 12:29] when one of the soldiers, who was obviously not being dissuaded, stepped forward and slashed
[12:29 --> 12:34] Pertinax with his sword, killing the emperor instantly.
[12:34 --> 12:41] Pertinax was 66 years old and had ruled the empire for 86 days.
[12:41 --> 12:46] This rash act of violence left Letus and the Praetorians in a dilly of a pickle.
[12:46 --> 12:51] As I'm sure Letus calmly explained without raising his voice or cussing anyone out, you
[12:51 --> 12:53] don't just kill an emperor.
[12:53 --> 12:58] At least, you don't kill an emperor without having a replacement ready to step in.
[12:58 --> 13:03] Because as it stands right now, there is no emperor, and no generally agreed upon mechanism
[13:03 --> 13:05] for selecting a new one.
[13:05 --> 13:09] The senate will argue that they have the right to elect the empire's new leader.
[13:09 --> 13:13] The armies out in the provinces will almost certainly ignore the senate and acclaim one
[13:13 --> 13:14] of their own generals.
[13:14 --> 13:19] Hell, every man in the empire will have his own pet candidate and be more than willing
[13:19 --> 13:23] to fight to the death to win this highly valuable and suddenly available prize.
[13:23 --> 13:29] This, he explained, is why you don't just kill an emperor.
[13:29 --> 13:33] Keeping his wits about him, though, Letus thought fast and determined that at the end
[13:33 --> 13:37] of the day, the Praetorians still really held all the cards here.
[13:37 --> 13:42] We'll just pick whoever we want, bully the senate into ratifying the choice, and have
[13:42 --> 13:48] everything wrapped up before the provincial governors even hear that Pertinax is dead.
[13:48 --> 13:51] But who did the Praetorians want?
[13:51 --> 13:54] At that moment, what they wanted was someone who would pay up when he was supposed to pay
[13:54 --> 13:56] up.
[13:56 --> 13:59] That was their whole beef with Pertinax, and the reason why they were standing over his
[13:59 --> 14:03] bloody body trying to figure out who to replace him with.
[14:03 --> 14:06] So Letus hit upon a great idea.
[14:06 --> 14:10] A really, really great idea that was just really, really great.
[14:10 --> 14:15] They would auction off the job to the highest bidder.
[14:16 --> 14:20] Letus ordered his agents out into the city to spread the news that Pertinax was dead
[14:20 --> 14:25] and that the Praetorians were entertaining bids to be his replacement.
[14:25 --> 14:29] What followed obviously became one of the most notorious incidents in Roman imperial
[14:29 --> 14:31] history.
[14:31 --> 14:35] No self-respecting senator was going to get into a bidding war to win the honor of becoming
[14:35 --> 14:41] the Praetorians' puppet, which meant that only senators of a more morally ambiguous
[14:41 --> 14:44] nature were going to enter into the auction.
[14:44 --> 14:49] But then again, if only morally ambiguous men entered in the bidding, then maybe it
[14:49 --> 14:53] was the duty of a self-respecting senator to step in and outbid the bad seeds.
[14:53 --> 14:57] It was quite a conundrum.
[14:57 --> 15:01] In the end, events moved so quickly that the bidding came down to two men, who were neither
[15:01 --> 15:06] inflexibly virtuous nor necessarily terrible men.
[15:06 --> 15:10] They just acted on their instincts, their vanity, and the belief that someone was going
[15:10 --> 15:14] to get the job, so it might as well be them.
[15:14 --> 15:20] The first was Pertinax's father-in-law, a man named Titus Flavius Sulpicianus.
[15:20 --> 15:25] Sulpicianus had been appointed city prefect upon his son-in-law's ascension, and when
[15:25 --> 15:29] the company of Praetorians had invaded the palace, Pertinax had dispatched Sulpicianus
[15:29 --> 15:35] down to the Praetorian camp to hopefully quell any further unrest.
[15:35 --> 15:39] So he found himself physically present when the murderous company returned base with his
[15:39 --> 15:43] son-in-law's head on a spike, and was the first to hear their plan to auction off the
[15:43 --> 15:46] imperial throne.
[15:46 --> 15:52] Sulpicianus, probably first out of a desire to simply restore order as quickly as possible,
[15:52 --> 15:57] put in a bid, but the Praetorians decided it was too low, and shouted from the ramparts
[15:57 --> 16:03] that anyone who could do better ought to come down straight away and do better.
[16:03 --> 16:08] The second man involved in this infamous auction, and the one who would eventually win the dubious
[16:08 --> 16:12] prize, was Marcus Didius Julianus.
[16:12 --> 16:16] He was enjoying a lavish dinner with his family when the news came that the imperial throne
[16:16 --> 16:18] was up for grabs.
[16:18 --> 16:23] According to most sources, Julianus was pushed into making a bid by his wife and daughter,
[16:23 --> 16:28] who were themselves hungrier for power than Julianus himself was, but sometimes I can't
[16:28 --> 16:33] help but take these portrayals of shrewish Roman women with a grain of salt.
[16:33 --> 16:39] If Julianus needed to be pushed into it, I doubt he needed to be pushed very hard.
[16:39 --> 16:44] But whether he jumped at the chance, or had to be pushed, or pulled, or nudged, or whatever,
[16:44 --> 16:48] Julianus rushed from his banquet table down to the Praetorian camp.
[16:48 --> 16:53] He was barred from actually passing through the gates by suspicious guards, but, undeterred,
[16:53 --> 16:57] he shouted his offer over the walls.
[16:57 --> 17:01] The men on the ramparts dutifully relayed Julianus's bid to their comrades in the center
[17:01 --> 17:05] of camp, and Solpicianus upped his bid accordingly.
[17:05 --> 17:10] The men raced back to the wall where they told Julianus what the new price was, and
[17:10 --> 17:13] Julianus upped his own bid accordingly.
[17:13 --> 17:16] Now this is what the Praetorians had in mind.
[17:16 --> 17:22] Finally, Solpicianus offered twenty thousand sesterces ahead for the privilege of becoming
[17:22 --> 17:27] emperor, an absurd sum that equaled something like eight times the annual salary of the
[17:27 --> 17:30] average Praetorian.
[17:30 --> 17:34] But Julianus, caught up in the moment and determined not to lose, promised twenty-five
[17:34 --> 17:37] thousand sesterces ahead.
[17:37 --> 17:43] At this last offer, the Praetorians were satisfied, and, maybe worried that continuing the auction
[17:43 --> 17:47] would lead both men to walk away from the table, declared Julianus the winner, ushered
[17:47 --> 17:52] him into camp, and acclaimed him emperor.
[17:52 --> 17:57] Proving that he was not totally morally bankrupt, which he really wasn't, Julianus stipulated
[17:57 --> 18:03] that his promised donative was contingent upon no harm coming to Solpicianus.
[18:03 --> 18:08] The Praetorians agreed, and let the losing bidder go, though he had to see himself out,
[18:08 --> 18:13] as the soldiers were all temporarily blinded by the massive dollar signs in their eyes.
[18:13 --> 18:15] They were all about to be rich men.
[18:15 --> 18:19] They should really do this more often.
[18:19 --> 18:23] The Praetorians then marched out into the streets to rouse the senate, and demand that
[18:23 --> 18:27] they assemble at once to make their choice official.
[18:27 --> 18:31] They came down to the forum, and after listening to Julianus make a speech about how all of
[18:31 --> 18:35] this wasn't nearly as dishonorable as it appeared, and reminding them that they all
[18:35 --> 18:40] knew him and knew him well, that he was a good man, and he would lead the empire back
[18:40 --> 18:42] to glory.
[18:42 --> 18:47] With armed soldiers literally standing over their shoulders, the senate nodded in agreement,
[18:47 --> 18:52] and Didius Julianus became emperor.
[18:52 --> 18:55] Now what he had said was basically true.
[18:55 --> 19:00] Marcus Didius Julianus had been around a long time, was well known, and not for infamous
[19:00 --> 19:01] reasons.
[19:01 --> 19:07] He had been born in the 130s, the exact date is under dispute, to an Italian father and
[19:07 --> 19:13] a Roman African mother, both of whom came from distinguished senatorial families.
[19:13 --> 19:18] By a stroke of luck, he wound up being raised in the home of Domitia Lucilla, the mother
[19:18 --> 19:20] of Marcus Aurelius.
[19:20 --> 19:25] He didn't have much contact with Marcus, who was at least fifteen years his senior,
[19:25 --> 19:30] but when Marcus became emperor, it did not hurt Julianus' career one bit that he was
[19:30 --> 19:33] a favorite of the emperor's mother.
[19:33 --> 19:38] He climbed up the cursus honorum in brisk fashion, and when the Marcomannic Wars broke out, he
[19:38 --> 19:43] found himself the governor of Upper Germany, which, while not exactly the front lines,
[19:43 --> 19:46] was still a key theater of the war.
[19:46 --> 19:50] Julianus and his fellows along the Rhine were tasked with fending off attacks on the
[19:50 --> 19:57] Lymus Germanicus and preventing the Germans from even thinking about expanding the conflict.
[19:57 --> 20:02] Julianus was completely successful in his mission, and deftly deflected numerous attempts
[20:02 --> 20:06] at invasion from local tribes allied with the Marcomanni.
[20:06 --> 20:11] As a reward for his good work, as I mentioned before, he was given a consulship in 175 along
[20:11 --> 20:15] with Pertinax.
[20:15 --> 20:19] During the reign of Commodus, he mostly kept his head down, and despite being accused of
[20:19 --> 20:23] involvement in one of the various plots against the emperor's life, he was acquitted and
[20:23 --> 20:28] wound up serving as provincial governor in Dithynia and then later succeeded Pertinax
[20:28 --> 20:30] as proconsul of Africa.
[20:30 --> 20:34] He was back in Rome and enjoying the life of a wealthy aristocrat during the last year
[20:34 --> 20:40] of Commodus' reign, however much a wealthy aristocrat could enjoy his life with Commodus'
[20:40 --> 20:45] mad whims hanging over his head all the time, and was finally, as I said, enjoying a nice
[20:45 --> 20:48] dinner when Pertinax was murdered.
[20:48 --> 20:52] Before the sun rose the next morning, he was in the imperial palace and likely wondering
[20:52 --> 20:57] if the night's events had been a strange dream.
[20:57 --> 20:58] But it was no dream.
[20:58 --> 21:00] Julianus was emperor.
[21:00 --> 21:05] It was time for the Praetorians to initiate the final phase of their brilliant plan, kick
[21:05 --> 21:08] back and live like kings.
[21:08 --> 21:12] But this final phase was premised on the assumption that there would be no repercussions for the
[21:12 --> 21:16] double crime of murdering Pertinax and selling off the throne.
[21:16 --> 21:21] This was, as you can imagine, as faulty an assumption as there has ever been in the long
[21:21 --> 21:24] history of faulty assumptions.
[21:24 --> 21:29] In the full light of day, the magnitude of how faulty that assumption was became all
[21:29 --> 21:31] too clear.
[21:31 --> 21:36] When Julianus traveled through the streets, he was hissed at and booed at by the people
[21:36 --> 21:39] who called him names and pelted him with rocks.
[21:39 --> 21:43] The Senate, with swords in their faces, had agreed to honor his claim to the throne, but
[21:43 --> 21:50] to a man they now reviled Julianus and considered his residence in the imperial palace a mockery.
[21:50 --> 21:55] If Pertinax's mistake had been ignoring the Praetorians, Julianus's crime was in paying
[21:55 --> 21:58] them exclusive attention.
[21:58 --> 22:03] Because outside the couple of thousand members of the guard, no one else supported him.
[22:03 --> 22:07] And there was a lot more men in the provincial armies than there were in the urban cohorts,
[22:07 --> 22:12] if you catch my drift.
[22:12 --> 22:15] Next week, the chickens will come home to roost.
[22:15 --> 22:19] None of the governors out in the provinces had any intention of offering fealty to this
[22:19 --> 22:22] imperial imposter.
[22:22 --> 22:27] And the three most powerful, Septimius Severus in Pannonia, Claudius Albinus in Britain,
[22:27 --> 22:32] and Paschinius Niger in Syria, will each further intend not only to brush aside Julianus and
[22:32 --> 22:37] his ridiculous claims to the throne, but to step in and take power for themselves.

[00:00 --> 00:14] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 124, The Tetrarchs at War.
[00:14 --> 00:20] We left off last week with our two newly appointed junior emperors, Constantius and Galerius,
[00:20 --> 00:24] ready to begin the wars they had been assigned by their senior colleagues.
[00:24 --> 00:29] In the north, Constantius was making final preparations for his invasion of Britain,
[00:29 --> 00:35] while in the east, Galerius outlined his strategy for punitive expedition against the Sassanids,
[00:35 --> 00:39] who had recently broken their treaty with Rome by invading Armenia.
[00:39 --> 00:44] For the moment, it looked like Constantius had drawn the short straw, forced to fight
[00:44 --> 00:49] fellow Romans in an attempt to retake a nearly impregnable island that had thus far proved
[00:49 --> 00:51] to be an impossible nut to crack.
[00:51 --> 00:56] Galerius, on the other hand, got to fight Persians, and in addition to the riches and
[00:57 --> 01:02] that usually came with campaigns in the east, Galerius also stood to be the man who finally
[01:02 --> 01:07] avenged the long un-avenged capture of Valerian.
[01:07 --> 01:11] Constantius' assignment was hard and unglamorous.
[01:11 --> 01:17] Galerius' was, well, not easy, but certainly not as hard, and it was most likely going
[01:17 --> 01:20] to prove ten times as glamorous.
[01:20 --> 01:25] But despite the relative difficulties of their respective wars, it would shortly be Constantius
[01:25 --> 01:30] who was bathed in glory for reconquering the province of Britannia, and Galerius who was
[01:30 --> 01:38] forced to walk a mile in front of Diocletian's litter as penance for the defeats he had suffered.
[01:38 --> 01:43] To deal with the western front first, we must follow Constantius from Milan up to Trier,
[01:43 --> 01:47] where he established a capital for his coming campaigns.
[01:47 --> 01:52] As I mentioned last week, Constantius was probably involved at the highest level in
[01:52 --> 01:59] the previous attempt to retake Britain, and so was acutely aware of what had gone wrong.
[01:59 --> 02:02] Two big mistakes appear to have stuck out to him.
[02:02 --> 02:07] First, despite the understanding that they needed to pacify the Germans before proceeding,
[02:07 --> 02:11] they had not taken this to its logical conclusion.
[02:11 --> 02:15] That is, they knocked out all the periphery tribes and established a launching pad from
[02:15 --> 02:21] the Rhine Delta, but they had done nothing to directly attack Cerocious' Frankish allies
[02:21 --> 02:23] in northern Gaul.
[02:23 --> 02:27] As long as Cerocious controlled both sides of the English channel, not only would his
[02:27 --> 02:32] supply and trade lines remain open, and those trade lines were a part of the key to his
[02:32 --> 02:37] legitimacy, but he would also be able to concentrate his defense forces on the eastern approach
[02:37 --> 02:43] to Britain, since that would be the only direction an invasion fleet would be able to come from.
[02:43 --> 02:48] So Constantius resolved to make his first objective, dislodging the Franks from the
[02:48 --> 02:50] Gallic coast.
[02:50 --> 02:54] Once they were out of the way, he would be able to deal with the second big mistake.
[02:54 --> 03:00] Namely, that a single invasion force approaching from a direction the enemy expected was no
[03:00 --> 03:03] way to break through a naval blockade.
[03:03 --> 03:08] You have to at least be a little sneaky about these things, and so Constantius resolved
[03:08 --> 03:15] to be a little more sneaky when it came time to put his own ships in the water.
[03:15 --> 03:20] Taken together, these two corrections wound up winning the war for Constantius.
[03:20 --> 03:23] The first, fatally undermined Cerocious' regime.
[03:23 --> 03:29] The second, completely paralyzed his successor.
[03:29 --> 03:35] Right away, that is in late 293 AD, just months after being made Caesar, Constantius launched
[03:35 --> 03:41] the first of his attacks in pursuit of objective one, neutralize the Franks.
[03:41 --> 03:46] The key port on the Gallic coast controlled by the Franks was Boulogne, and so, not beating
[03:46 --> 03:52] around the bush, Constantius laid siege to the city in the autumn of 293.
[03:52 --> 03:56] The Frankish leaders felt pretty good about their ability to hold out.
[03:56 --> 04:00] Constantius was in no position to threaten their access to the sea, and the approach
[04:00 --> 04:04] by land was thin and heavily fortified.
[04:04 --> 04:09] But Constantius was not here to mess around, and even though no one, probably not even
[04:09 --> 04:15] his own men, expected it, the Caesar went right for the jugular and began to threaten
[04:15 --> 04:19] the Franks' access to the sea.
[04:19 --> 04:24] It's a little hard to describe, but in essence, Constantius had his men build a dam across
[04:24 --> 04:28] the harbor, cutting off any possible sea traffic.
[04:28 --> 04:33] Though he had no navy to speak of, Constantius was thus able to cut off the Frankish ships
[04:33 --> 04:37] from their main port of call, and leave the defenders of Boulogne stranded without the
[04:37 --> 04:40] possibility of relief.
[04:40 --> 04:45] It did not take long for them to recognize that their situation was hopeless, and capitulate
[04:45 --> 04:48] to Constantius' legions.
[04:48 --> 04:53] The capture of Boulogne, while in and of itself a good thing, actually turned out to be a
[04:53 --> 04:57] bigger boon to Constantius' chances of winning back Britain than even he could have predicted
[04:57 --> 05:00] at the outset.
[05:00 --> 05:04] Because the loss of access to the mainland caused by the fall of Boulogne dealt a major
[05:04 --> 05:12] blow to Cerocious' legitimacy, and left him vulnerable to a murderous palace coup.
[05:12 --> 05:16] I haven't been able to find a good answer to the question of what the conspirators thought
[05:16 --> 05:22] they were going to accomplish by assassinating Cerocious, but in the winter of 293, a cabal
[05:22 --> 05:27] led by the British finance minister, Electus, killed the man who had been there Augustus
[05:27 --> 05:30] these last seven years.
[05:30 --> 05:35] With Cerocious out of the way, Boulogne remained lost, and the little British empire was now
[05:35 --> 05:38] deprived of its most able general.
[05:38 --> 05:42] So yeah, I'm not sure what they were hoping to accomplish.
[05:42 --> 05:47] Sometimes, I guess, power is its own reward.
[05:47 --> 05:53] Electus declared himself Augustus, and the noose was pulled a bit tighter.
[05:53 --> 05:58] But the now practically inevitable execution of the British regime did not follow right
[05:58 --> 05:59] away.
[05:59 --> 06:04] The problem seems to have been that in the aftermath of Maximian's defeat, there was
[06:04 --> 06:08] no concerted effort to rebuild the navy that had just been annihilated.
[06:08 --> 06:12] So in the aftermath of his own victory at Boulogne some four years later, Constantius
[06:12 --> 06:15] still had no navy.
[06:15 --> 06:20] As with the reason for Cerocious's assassination, I haven't been able to find a good explanation
[06:20 --> 06:26] for why a fleet was not being rebuilt, especially since everyone knew there was going to be
[06:26 --> 06:28] a second invasion attempt.
[06:28 --> 06:34] But if I had to speculate, I would say that no one really knew when or under what circumstances
[06:34 --> 06:39] the next invasion would take place, so why waste time and resources constructing a fleet
[06:39 --> 06:45] that might sit idle for years, and in the interim be sitting ducks for Frankish attacks
[06:45 --> 06:50] that might see the new ships destroyed before they even had a chance to launch?
[06:50 --> 06:52] But I'm just guessing.
[06:52 --> 06:57] All we really know is that following the capture of Boulogne and the assassination of Cerocious,
[06:57 --> 07:02] two years would pass before Constantius set sail to retake the island.
[07:02 --> 07:07] In the meantime, he seems to have followed the same basic policy as Maximian and Diocletian,
[07:07 --> 07:12] and campaigned extensively against the Alamani in order to ensure that the mainland would
[07:12 --> 07:16] be pacified when he headed across the water.
[07:16 --> 07:21] And of course, he continued to campaign against the Franks until they had been brought completely
[07:21 --> 07:27] to heel, culminating with the placement of a new pro-Roman king at the head of their
[07:27 --> 07:30] confederation.
[07:30 --> 07:33] By 295, though, things were all set.
[07:33 --> 07:38] Maximian moved up from Milan to watch the Rhine frontier, and Constantius readied his
[07:38 --> 07:40] fleets to sail.
[07:40 --> 07:41] What's that?
[07:41 --> 07:43] Fleets, you say?
[07:43 --> 07:44] That's right.
[07:44 --> 07:49] Taking advantage of his control of the Gallic coast, Constantius divided up his forces in
[07:49 --> 07:54] two, launching them from two different ports with two different landing spots in mind,
[07:54 --> 08:00] so as to divide the enemy and keep them guessing as to where the invasion was headed.
[08:00 --> 08:04] Constantius himself launched from Boulogne on his way to Dover, while his Praetorian
[08:04 --> 08:09] prefect Asclepiodotus launched from the mouth of the Seine River on his way to the Isle
[08:09 --> 08:12] of Wight.
[08:12 --> 08:17] Just as with Maximian's invasion, supposedly, the short trip to Britain was complicated
[08:17 --> 08:19] by bad weather.
[08:19 --> 08:24] But with two fleets on the water instead of just one, the operation was able to keep moving
[08:24 --> 08:29] forward, rather than coming to a complete standstill when Constantius' ships were
[08:29 --> 08:31] stalled out in the storm.
[08:31 --> 08:36] Asclepiodotus' fleet was able to navigate the rough seas and make a landing somewhere
[08:36 --> 08:38] near Southampton.
[08:38 --> 08:44] Once ashore, the prefect burned his ships, not just to prevent their capture, but also
[08:44 --> 08:48] to remind his men that there would be no retreat.
[08:48 --> 08:53] Victory or death, that is what the gods had in store for them.
[08:54 --> 08:59] Now, Alectus, the self-proclaimed Augustus of Britain, who had been running the island
[08:59 --> 09:05] for the last two years, was not a tenth of the soldier Corocius had been.
[09:05 --> 09:09] Believing Constantius was coming from the southeast, since that is where the previous invasion
[09:09 --> 09:14] had come from, Alectus had massed his forces down in Kent to meet what he thought would
[09:14 --> 09:17] be a single invading army.
[09:17 --> 09:23] When reports suddenly began arriving detailing an invasion force marching north from Southampton,
[09:23 --> 09:28] Alectus panicked and pulled his forces up to block the road to London.
[09:28 --> 09:33] But in his haste to get the army moving, they became disorganized and spread out, with the
[09:33 --> 09:38] British legions proper divided from the Frankish mercenaries the British regime had been employing
[09:38 --> 09:42] since Corocius first established his independence.
[09:42 --> 09:46] So the defense force Alectus planted on the road to meet the advancing Romans was not
[09:46 --> 09:52] at full strength, nor well organized, nor well led.
[09:52 --> 09:59] Asclepiodotus did not have to work very hard to smash them to pieces, and Alectus himself
[09:59 --> 10:02] died in the fighting.
[10:02 --> 10:08] When the weather cleared up, Constantius landed his forces and began his own march on London.
[10:08 --> 10:13] With the news of Alectus' defeat already circulating throughout the island, the arrival
[10:13 --> 10:17] of Constantius suddenly had a whole new vibe.
[10:17 --> 10:22] The Frankish mercenaries who had not fought and died were now viewed as a far greater
[10:22 --> 10:27] threat than Constantius and his legions.
[10:27 --> 10:32] The citizens of Britain were shutting up their homes and cities not because they feared Constantius,
[10:32 --> 10:38] but because they feared what the Franks would do now that they were off the leash.
[10:38 --> 10:43] And their fear was well placed, as it appears that the Franks took Alectus' defeat as
[10:43 --> 10:49] their cue to sack as much of the countryside as they could.
[10:49 --> 10:53] Constantius caught up with them before they reached London, though, and in a quick battle
[10:53 --> 10:57] annihilated the marauding Franks.
[10:57 --> 11:01] When Constantius set sail, he had every reason to believe that the battle for London would
[11:01 --> 11:03] be a hard-fought affair.
[11:03 --> 11:08] But now, as he approached the capital, he found himself greeted not as an enemy, but
[11:08 --> 11:11] as a beloved hero.
[11:11 --> 11:15] This great and mighty Caesar had delivered Britain from the destructive wrath of the
[11:15 --> 11:16] Franks.
[11:16 --> 11:21] Just like that, the province of Britannia was reabsorbed, more than willingly at this
[11:21 --> 11:24] point, into the empire.
[11:24 --> 11:29] To celebrate this victory, Constantius began issuing coins with his own face, bearing the
[11:29 --> 11:36] legend Restorer of Eternal Light.
[11:36 --> 11:40] Just as Constantius was celebrating his victory in the west, Galerius was beginning his campaign
[11:41 --> 11:43] in the east.
[11:43 --> 11:47] After spending most of the last two years in Egypt, the Caesar had been brought north
[11:47 --> 11:54] to Antioch to confer with Diocletian and figure out what to do about the resurgent Sassanids.
[11:54 --> 11:59] Diocletian had been watching with alarm as the new Persian king, Narcissus, adopted an
[11:59 --> 12:03] increasingly hostile posture towards Rome.
[12:03 --> 12:08] At first, this new posture manifested itself in relatively harmless displays of strength
[12:08 --> 12:12] by the Persians along their western frontier.
[12:12 --> 12:17] But lately, Narcissus had been making troubling alliances with the tribes and petty kingdoms
[12:17 --> 12:18] of the borderland.
[12:18 --> 12:26] Then, in either 295 or 296, the Persian king moved out of the theatrical and into the martial
[12:26 --> 12:34] by invading Armenia, defeating and deposing the pro-Roman king Tiridates in the process.
[12:34 --> 12:39] From Armenia, Narcissus moved his forces south through Ossorini and stood poised now on the
[12:39 --> 12:43] Syrian border.
[12:43 --> 12:47] Diocletian knew that Narcissus was self-consciously styling himself as the new Sharpor and it
[12:47 --> 12:52] was entirely likely that the Persian king was getting ready to invade Syria and sack
[12:52 --> 12:56] Antioch just as Sharpor had done.
[12:56 --> 13:01] Diocletian was unwilling to wait for the other shoe to drop and so in mid-296, Galerius marched
[13:01 --> 13:06] out at the head of an army to confront the Persians before they decided to cross into
[13:06 --> 13:10] Roman territory.
[13:10 --> 13:16] The two armies met near Cary, a site of Crassus' great defeat some three centuries before,
[13:16 --> 13:21] and after wasting precious little time on diplomatic niceties, the Romans and Sassanids
[13:21 --> 13:24] threw themselves at one another.
[13:24 --> 13:28] The result was an unmitigated disaster for Rome.
[13:28 --> 13:34] Galerius ran his heavy cavalry and archery detachments in perfect tandem and this Persian
[13:34 --> 13:38] 1-2 punch caught the Romans completely flat-footed.
[13:38 --> 13:43] After suffering extensive losses, Galerius was able to extract what was left of his army
[13:43 --> 13:48] and lead them on a limping march back to Antioch.
[13:48 --> 13:54] Legend has it that upon his arrival, Galerius was met outside the city by a furious Diocletian,
[13:54 --> 13:59] who made the defeated Caesar walk a mile on foot in front of Diocletian's imperial
[13:59 --> 14:03] litter as punishment for his failure.
[14:03 --> 14:08] It is likely that this episode is a colorful invention, but there is no doubt that in the
[14:08 --> 14:16] aftermath of the defeat, Diocletian made Galerius take full responsibility for the episode.
[14:16 --> 14:20] Such was the cost of maintaining the Tetrarchy's stability.
[14:20 --> 14:25] Losses would be shared by all four men equally, but defeats would be the responsibility of
[14:25 --> 14:30] the losing general alone.
[14:30 --> 14:37] That being said, in all likelihood, Diocletian's public shaming of Galerius is a later invention.
[14:37 --> 14:43] For one thing, no contemporary source mentions the incident, but perhaps more importantly,
[14:43 --> 14:47] it would not at all have been in keeping with Diocletian's character.
[14:47 --> 14:53] The senior Augustus was careful to cultivate a public image of the Imperial College as
[14:53 --> 14:58] one of unwavering mutual support and unity of purpose, as was so demonstrated in the
[14:58 --> 15:02] aftermath of Maximian's failed British invasion.
[15:02 --> 15:07] To humiliate Galerius out in the open like that would not just have poked holes in that
[15:07 --> 15:12] public image, but it likely would have done real damage to the actual unity Diocletian
[15:12 --> 15:15] was trying to maintain behind the scenes.
[15:15 --> 15:20] Eradicating the conditions that led to the rampant civil wars of the crisis years was
[15:20 --> 15:25] one of Diocletian's biggest concerns, and I highly doubt that he would have so carelessly
[15:25 --> 15:31] undermined all of his efforts by slapping his junior colleague around in public.
[15:31 --> 15:37] Honor was a huge part of what made these men tick, and humiliating Galerius so brazenly
[15:37 --> 15:42] might have ticked the Caesar off to the point that he would have viewed overthrowing Diocletian
[15:42 --> 15:45] as a reasonable response.
[15:45 --> 15:50] So while I have no trouble believing that Diocletian balled Galerius out in private,
[15:50 --> 15:55] in public I can't imagine he would have done anything to risk Imperial unity, especially
[15:55 --> 16:01] for something as petty as making a guy walk in front of your horse for a little while.
[16:01 --> 16:04] But it was not all bad for the Romans.
[16:04 --> 16:08] Despite the fact that he had been bested in the field, Galerius had obviously put up enough
[16:08 --> 16:14] of a fight that the Persian king, whatever his intentions had been before, did not immediately
[16:14 --> 16:18] follow up his victory with an invasion of Syria.
[16:18 --> 16:23] And it's a good thing that he didn't, because just a few months after the defeat of Galerius,
[16:23 --> 16:28] word came up from Egypt that yet another revolt had broken out.
[16:28 --> 16:32] The origins of this latest unrest will be dealt with more fully a few episodes down
[16:32 --> 16:39] the road when I dive into Diocletian's economic reforms, so just know for now that Diocletian's
[16:39 --> 16:44] crackdown on tax evasion did not at all go over well with the perpetually tax evading
[16:44 --> 16:47] Egyptians.
[16:47 --> 16:52] Leaving Galerius in Syria to oversee the rebuilding of the frontier defenses, Diocletian decided
[16:52 --> 16:59] to personally see to the problem of Egypt.
[16:59 --> 17:04] In 297, what had begun as a series of local uprisings had coalesced into a province-wide
[17:04 --> 17:11] movement that even had its own self-proclaimed Augustus, a man named Lucius Domitius Domitianus,
[17:11 --> 17:17] who was attempting to reassert all the special privileges Egypt and in particular Alexandria
[17:17 --> 17:22] had always enjoyed and that Diocletian was now trying to take away.
[17:22 --> 17:28] Diocletian, though, had a vision for the future of the empire, and special treatment for special
[17:28 --> 17:32] people was not at all a part of that vision.
[17:32 --> 17:37] Just ask the citizens of Italy, who at that same time were having all of their longhill
[17:37 --> 17:40] privileges revoked one by one.
[17:40 --> 17:41] Pay taxes?
[17:41 --> 17:44] You've got to be joking.
[17:44 --> 17:48] But like I say, we'll get into all that later.
[17:48 --> 17:53] So Diocletian came down to Egypt, and despite stiff resistance from the natives, he thoroughly
[17:53 --> 17:57] smacked down the rebellion with an iron hand.
[17:57 --> 18:01] The emperor had no intention of allowing Egypt to become the bleeding ulcer that Britain
[18:01 --> 18:08] had been for so long, and mercy towards the rebels was in short supply.
[18:08 --> 18:13] There is even a charming little story about how, when he finally took Alexandria after
[18:13 --> 18:18] a surprisingly difficult nine-month siege, the enraged Diocletian announced that he was
[18:18 --> 18:24] going to slaughter everyone in the city until the blood ran up to his horse's knee.
[18:24 --> 18:30] Then, as if on cue, the tired horse decided at that very moment to kneel down, knees,
[18:30 --> 18:34] of course, now touching the ground.
[18:34 --> 18:38] Diocletian took the hint the gods sent him and ordered a stop to the massacre he was
[18:38 --> 18:41] intending to unleash on the Alexandrians.
[18:41 --> 18:46] This little story is even more charming because in gratitude the Alexandrians allegedly built
[18:46 --> 18:53] a statue in honor of Diocletian's horse once the emperor had moved on.
[18:53 --> 18:58] By the end of 297, though, the revolt was nipped in the bud, Domitianus was dead, and
[18:58 --> 19:05] the emperor could turn his attention back to the Persian problem.
[19:05 --> 19:10] Back up in Antioch, Galerius had spent the year successfully rebuilding the Syrian legions,
[19:10 --> 19:15] and when Diocletian arrived, the senior Augustus was pleased to discover that his junior colleague
[19:15 --> 19:19] was ready to go back on the offensive.
[19:19 --> 19:24] And it was the offensive they would have to go back on because, despite his initially
[19:24 --> 19:29] bold moves, King Narcissus had learned that the Romans were not the pushover he had perhaps
[19:29 --> 19:33] led himself to believe they were.
[19:33 --> 19:37] He didn't give up his position in Armenia or Mesopotamia, but he also didn't press
[19:37 --> 19:40] on any further.
[19:40 --> 19:44] When it became obvious that the Persian king was not going to invade and press his luck
[19:44 --> 19:50] inside Roman territory, the emperors decided to take the fight to him again.
[19:50 --> 19:56] As we've seen over and over again, the Romans never took a defeat as the last word
[19:56 --> 20:04] in anything, and it was in fact almost axiomatic that the last word had to be a Roman victory.
[20:04 --> 20:09] If the Romans lost, it was only a setback on the road to final victory.
[20:09 --> 20:13] It could not possibly mean an end to hostilities, because the only time the Romans allowed an
[20:13 --> 20:17] end to hostilities was when the Romans won.
[20:17 --> 20:21] They were simply a maddening opponent that way.
[20:21 --> 20:26] So in 298 AD, Galerius marched out at the head of an army to track down Narcissus and
[20:26 --> 20:31] bring an end to hostilities.
[20:31 --> 20:35] This time, the Caesar played it a bit smarter.
[20:35 --> 20:38] Rather than heading straight for the Persian army, which was then encamped on the plains
[20:38 --> 20:44] of Mesopotamia, he decided to take the road in through the mountains of Armenia and force
[20:44 --> 20:49] Narcissus to fight on ground that Galerius hoped would neutralize the Persian heavy cavalry
[20:49 --> 20:52] advantage.
[20:52 --> 20:56] Narcissus took the bait, and this time when the two armies met, the legions routed the
[20:56 --> 21:01] Sassanids, though the battle was not at all decisive.
[21:01 --> 21:06] Narcissus retreated and Galerius pursued, hoping to catch the Persians before they reestablished
[21:06 --> 21:09] themselves on better ground.
[21:09 --> 21:14] Luckily, the Persian withdrawal was haphazard, and with the help of local guides, Galerius
[21:14 --> 21:19] was able to close the distance between the two armies and launch an attack on the utterly
[21:19 --> 21:23] surprised Sassanids when they were still in their camp one night.
[21:23 --> 21:26] This time, the battle was decisive.
[21:26 --> 21:31] Not only was the Sassanid army cut to pieces, but Narcissus was forced to flee for his life
[21:31 --> 21:37] without being able to stop and collect his wives, his harem, or his royal treasury, all
[21:37 --> 21:42] of which fell into the hand of the triumphant Galerius.
[21:42 --> 21:47] The Sassanid military was now broken, the king was now running for his life, and valuable
[21:47 --> 21:50] hostages had now been seized.
[21:50 --> 21:53] Now hostilities could end.
[21:53 --> 21:57] Well, not quite yet.
[21:57 --> 22:02] Galerius took a victory lap down through Mesopotamia in order to sack the Persian capital of Ctesiphon,
[22:02 --> 22:06] which at this point was practically a rite of passage for Roman generals serving in the
[22:06 --> 22:07] east.
[22:07 --> 22:12] Unchecked, Galerius probably would have marched all the way to India, but he was stopped by
[22:12 --> 22:17] Diocletian, who was able to see the bigger picture.
[22:17 --> 22:21] Diocletian had no desire to rule over Persia.
[22:21 --> 22:26] He just wanted peace with the Sassanids on the best possible terms, and with the king's
[22:26 --> 22:31] wives and harem being treated with the utmost respect by their Roman captors, Diocletian
[22:31 --> 22:36] was now in a position to leverage an even better deal than he had worked out with Bahram
[22:36 --> 22:38] in 287.
[22:38 --> 22:41] And leverage a better deal he did.
[22:41 --> 22:47] A summit was arranged between the Roman emperors and Persian ambassadors at Nispis in 299,
[22:47 --> 22:51] where Diocletian laid out his terms.
[22:51 --> 22:57] After an amusing but likely fictitious exchange that saw the Persian envoys attempt to lecture
[22:57 --> 23:03] the Romans on the importance of being magnanimous in defeat, and Galerius then practically blowing
[23:03 --> 23:07] a blood vessel, demanding to know where the Persians got off lecturing the Romans about
[23:07 --> 23:15] magnanimity when the stuffed corpse of Valerian was still being held as a Sassanid trophy.
[23:15 --> 23:20] After this, the Persian envoys agreed to all the Roman terms.
[23:20 --> 23:25] Not only was Armenia brought back into the Roman fold, but for the first time the kingdoms
[23:25 --> 23:29] of the Caucasus Mountains were made Roman clients, and cities on the east side of the
[23:29 --> 23:33] Tigris were ceded to Roman control.
[23:33 --> 23:38] In every way Diocletian got the better of the Persians in the peace of Nispis, and the
[23:38 --> 23:45] capture of the Persian royal family was understood to balance the scales for the capture of Valerian.
[23:45 --> 23:52] All of which was nice, but what was even nicer was that the peace brokered in 299 would last
[23:52 --> 24:00] for the next 40 years, and that was a victory for everyone.
[24:00 --> 24:07] So it was that at the close of the third century, a century defined by the empire's near collapse,
[24:07 --> 24:09] Rome was as strong as ever.
[24:09 --> 24:15] 15 years of political stability overseen by one of the best leaders the empire had ever
[24:15 --> 24:16] seen.
[24:16 --> 24:23] Internal revolts squelched, external threats neutralized, and a socio-economic order redesigned
[24:23 --> 24:27] to match with the realities of this new age.
[24:27 --> 24:31] Rome would never again be allowed the kind of freedom of movement it had enjoyed during
[24:31 --> 24:37] its various golden ages, and it would indeed be a constant daily struggle just to maintain
[24:37 --> 24:40] what Diocletian had established.
[24:40 --> 24:44] But something had been established.
[24:44 --> 24:50] In the next few weeks, we are going to investigate what exactly had been established, starting
[24:50 --> 24:55] next time with an analysis of Rome's new military posture.
[24:55 --> 25:00] After that, we'll deal with Diocletian's economic reforms, including his famous edict
[25:00 --> 25:06] on prices, and then cover his reorganization of the governmental apparatus.
[25:06 --> 25:12] Taken together, Diocletian transformed just about every aspect of Roman life.
[25:12 --> 25:17] But again, as I mentioned before, he was not trying to create a new world order.
[25:17 --> 25:20] He was trying to save the old world order.

[01:01 --> 01:09] Hello and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 72, Vitellius and Vespasian.
[01:10 --> 01:15] In April of 69 AD, the Romans watched Vitellius, their fourth emperor in less
[01:15 --> 01:17] than a year, ascend to the throne.
[01:18 --> 01:22] When Nero had committed suicide, conventional wisdom held that old Galba
[01:22 --> 01:26] would reign for a few years and then hand power to an heir, presumably some
[01:26 --> 01:28] young man with many years ahead of him.
[01:29 --> 01:33] If anything, the death of Nero was supposed to open up a period of stability.
[01:33 --> 01:38] But here they were 10 months later and the Senate was recognizing yet another emperor.
[01:39 --> 01:42] There was nothing anyone could really do about it, except hope that this
[01:42 --> 01:44] finally was the end of it.
[01:44 --> 01:46] But it was not to be.
[01:46 --> 01:51] Vitellius would not live to see the new year, and before the final emperor of this
[01:51 --> 01:55] chaotic period strode into office, there would be more bloodshed, more misery,
[01:55 --> 01:57] more betrayal, and more destruction.
[01:58 --> 02:02] Though he was of mild disposition and never would have ordered the crimes
[02:02 --> 02:06] committed in his name, when the forces of Vespasian stormed into Italy on
[02:06 --> 02:09] their way to Rome, they brought with them the worst civil war had to offer.
[02:10 --> 02:13] It would be a bloody end to a bloody year.
[02:13 --> 02:17] The only silver lining was that it would be an end.
[02:17 --> 02:21] Vespasian would reign for years, not months, and his sons for years after
[02:21 --> 02:21] that.
[02:22 --> 02:24] The luck of the Flavians would see to that.
[02:26 --> 02:30] The suicide of Otho had taken everyone by surprise.
[02:31 --> 02:34] Frenden Fowl alike expected the young emperor to fight it out with
[02:34 --> 02:35] Vitellius to the bitter end.
[02:36 --> 02:41] After going to such extreme lengths to seize power, it was inconceivable
[02:41 --> 02:44] that he would simply give up after suffering what could be seen as no more
[02:44 --> 02:46] than a minor setback at Bedriacum.
[02:47 --> 02:51] But rather than receiving further instructions, the legions that had
[02:51 --> 02:54] pledged their loyalty to Otho were simply informed that their leader was
[02:54 --> 02:54] dead.
[02:55 --> 02:58] And rather than preparing themselves for the next battle, the legions
[02:58 --> 03:02] that had pledged their loyalty to Vitellius were simply informed that
[03:02 --> 03:03] they had won.
[03:03 --> 03:06] No one knew quite what to do next.
[03:07 --> 03:11] Vitellius, though, knew exactly what to do, throw a huge party.
[03:12 --> 03:16] The new emperor, not officially designated as such yet, was staying in
[03:16 --> 03:19] Lugdunum, the Roman capital of Gaul, when he got the news that
[03:19 --> 03:20] Otho was dead.
[03:21 --> 03:24] Valens and Chisina were told to make sure their respective armies
[03:24 --> 03:27] were in order and that the enemy was fully subdued, and then
[03:27 --> 03:30] they were to make haste to Gaul for an extravagant banquet.
[03:31 --> 03:34] When the two generals arrived, they sat on opposite sides of the new
[03:34 --> 03:37] emperor at the main table, and everyone got good and drunk, singing
[03:37 --> 03:41] each other's praises and mocking the Othonians well into the night.
[03:42 --> 03:45] The excesses of the victory celebration would set the tone for
[03:45 --> 03:49] Vitellius' reign, or at least the historical depiction of Vitellius'
[03:49 --> 03:52] reign, which may or may not be the same thing.
[03:54 --> 03:57] The problem for Vitellius is that none of the ancient historians
[03:57 --> 03:58] were on his side.
[03:59 --> 04:01] The men who recorded the events of the year of the four
[04:01 --> 04:04] emperors were obviously writing after Vespasian had emerged
[04:04 --> 04:08] victorious, and I think we all know what they say about who
[04:08 --> 04:09] gets to write history.
[04:10 --> 04:13] Vespasian would have naturally justified his own actions by
[04:13 --> 04:16] repeating the worst rumors about Vitellius' excesses in
[04:16 --> 04:20] order to portray himself as a savior, and so Roman scholars
[04:20 --> 04:24] became steeped in Vespasian's version of who did what to who,
[04:24 --> 04:25] why, and how.
[04:27 --> 04:29] Tacitus may have published his account well after the
[04:29 --> 04:33] death of Domitian, but his early career was influenced by
[04:33 --> 04:37] first Vespasian and then Titus, and it is understandable that
[04:37 --> 04:40] he portrayed Vitellius in less than glowing terms.
[04:41 --> 04:44] But it was not just Flavian propaganda that Vitellius is up
[04:44 --> 04:44] against.
[04:45 --> 04:47] Suetonius' father fought with the Othonians at
[04:47 --> 04:50] Bedriacum, and if you think that the father had anything
[04:50 --> 04:54] good to say to the son about the gluttonous usurper from
[04:54 --> 04:56] Germania, well, you haven't read Twelve Caesars.
[04:57 --> 05:00] This is all to say that the caricature of Vitellius that
[05:00 --> 05:04] has been handed down to us may bear only a passing resemblance
[05:04 --> 05:05] to the man himself.
[05:05 --> 05:09] That being said, though, it sure is a fun caricature, so let's
[05:09 --> 05:10] just roll with it.
[05:11 --> 05:15] It took Vitellius six weeks to wind his way down to Rome,
[05:15 --> 05:19] leading his army from the Rhine on a meandering, debauched
[05:19 --> 05:19] road trip.
[05:20 --> 05:23] With some 60,000 soldiers, followers, and hangers-on
[05:23 --> 05:27] accompanying him, discipline was lax and the toll taken on
[05:27 --> 05:28] the towns they passed high.
[05:30 --> 05:33] Along the way, the new emperor detoured to the battlefield at
[05:33 --> 05:36] Bedriacum and pronounced the stench of death that still hung
[05:36 --> 05:38] over the field sweet to his nose.
[05:38 --> 05:41] He then swung by Otho's modest burial site and
[05:41 --> 05:44] pronounced it a small grave for a small man.
[05:45 --> 05:48] Then he went back to his traveling party and got drunk.
[05:48 --> 05:50] See, isn't this Vitellius' fun?
[05:50 --> 05:54] He finally arrived in Roman June and had every intention of
[05:54 --> 05:57] marching into the capital in full triumphal regalia, but was
[05:57 --> 06:00] reminded that it would be in really, really poor form to
[06:00 --> 06:04] celebrate victory over his fellow Romans, so he entered
[06:04 --> 06:07] the gates dressed in a simple civilian toga instead.
[06:09 --> 06:12] The actual reign of Vitellius is not particularly well
[06:12 --> 06:15] documented, but the general consensus is that while
[06:15 --> 06:17] Vitellius banqueted four times a day, attended the
[06:17 --> 06:21] and then slept it off, Valens and Kaisina were left in
[06:21 --> 06:23] control of the day-to-day operations.
[06:24 --> 06:27] Partners in war, however, the two became bitter enemies in
[06:27 --> 06:31] peace, and nothing so defined the Vitellian regime as the
[06:31 --> 06:33] rivalry between Valens and Kaisina.
[06:35 --> 06:37] Every appointment, every assignment, every
[06:37 --> 06:40] appropriation became a cause worth fighting for.
[06:41 --> 06:43] They both stacked the reorganized legions, civil
[06:43 --> 06:46] service, and praetorian guard with their own clients
[06:46 --> 06:50] so that every level of every department became a front in
[06:50 --> 06:51] their running political war.
[06:52 --> 06:55] In the end, Valens would win the war for influence,
[06:56 --> 06:58] leading Kaisina to famously betray his third
[06:58 --> 07:00] emperor in 15 months.
[07:03 --> 07:05] The Vitellian regime was unable to accomplish that
[07:05 --> 07:07] much in their brief time at the helm.
[07:07 --> 07:10] They raised some taxes, threw some games, and tried
[07:10 --> 07:13] to manage four emperors' worth of consular promises in
[07:13 --> 07:15] an effort to keep the nobility happy.
[07:16 --> 07:19] But between the first battle of Bedriacum in April and the
[07:19 --> 07:22] second in October, it's not like they had a lot of time
[07:22 --> 07:23] to work with.
[07:24 --> 07:26] The only really significant thing they did upon taking
[07:26 --> 07:30] office was to disband the existing praetorian guard and
[07:30 --> 07:33] then reform it using their own troops to ensure that all
[07:33 --> 07:35] the Othonian loyalists were purged.
[07:36 --> 07:39] This was maybe a good idea and maybe not, but the
[07:39 --> 07:42] final upshot was that all the best troops were
[07:42 --> 07:43] siphoned out of the Rhine legions.
[07:43 --> 07:46] So when Kaisina headed north to face Antonius's
[07:46 --> 07:50] invading army, the force he led was not the same army
[07:50 --> 07:51] he had led against Otho.
[07:52 --> 07:54] Oh, and all those fired praetorians?
[07:55 --> 07:57] When they heard that the legions of the east were
[07:57 --> 07:59] promising to topple Vitellius, guess whose banner
[07:59 --> 08:00] they all flocked to.
[08:01 --> 08:04] So the reformation of the praetorians may have seemed
[08:04 --> 08:06] like a good idea at the time, but all it ultimately
[08:06 --> 08:09] did was weaken Vitellius and strengthen Vespasian.
[08:10 --> 08:12] So yeah, maybe not such a good idea.
[08:14 --> 08:18] Speaking of Vespasian, when we last left him, he was in
[08:18 --> 08:20] the process of putting down the great Jewish revolt,
[08:21 --> 08:23] specifically contemplating when and how he was going to
[08:23 --> 08:24] take Jerusalem.
[08:25 --> 08:28] But when news of Nero's suicide arrived, he put the
[08:28 --> 08:31] brakes on the campaign, unsure of whether Galba planned
[08:31 --> 08:34] to adopt a harsh or lenient posture towards the Jews.
[08:35 --> 08:38] Plus, as one of Nero's appointees, he had every
[08:38 --> 08:41] reason to fear that Galba would recall him from his
[08:41 --> 08:45] So he wrote the new emperor a friendly letter, pledging
[08:45 --> 08:47] loyalty and requesting instructions.
[08:48 --> 08:50] Fearing the worst when Galba ignored his overture,
[08:51 --> 08:53] Vespasian sent his 28-year-old son Titus to Rome
[08:53 --> 08:55] to feel Galba out.
[08:55 --> 08:58] But before Titus could arrive, he received news of
[08:58 --> 09:01] Galba's assassination and decided to turn back,
[09:01 --> 09:04] rather than allow himself to become a pawn in the
[09:04 --> 09:06] brewing war between Otho and Vitellius.
[09:08 --> 09:11] Vespasian commended his son's decision and then
[09:11 --> 09:13] began to mull over what to do.
[09:14 --> 09:16] Obviously, he should try to keep himself at arm's
[09:16 --> 09:19] length from the conflict between Otho and Vitellius
[09:19 --> 09:21] and wait to see how it played out.
[09:22 --> 09:24] He was obligated to swear loyalty to Otho, of
[09:24 --> 09:26] course, but that did not mean that he had to lift
[09:26 --> 09:28] a finger to help him.
[09:28 --> 09:31] So Vespasian settled back to wait for further news
[09:31 --> 09:32] from the West.
[09:33 --> 09:36] While he waited, though, a thought began to form
[09:36 --> 09:37] in his head.
[09:37 --> 09:40] Back home, every two-bit general with a legion at
[09:40 --> 09:42] his disposal was making his bid for power.
[09:43 --> 09:46] What makes them so much more qualified than, you
[09:46 --> 09:47] know, me?
[09:49 --> 09:50] The future king of the world will come from
[09:50 --> 09:52] Judea, the prophecy had said.
[09:53 --> 09:55] Vespasian was beginning to think that he could
[09:55 --> 09:57] make that prophecy come true.
[09:58 --> 10:00] But that is not to say that this was all
[10:00 --> 10:01] Vespasian's idea.
[10:02 --> 10:05] Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of
[10:05 --> 10:07] Syria, had gone as high as he could hope to go
[10:07 --> 10:09] on public life under existing conditions and
[10:09 --> 10:13] was dissatisfied with how low a height it was.
[10:13 --> 10:16] Stuck in the largely diplomatic post of Syria,
[10:16 --> 10:18] he was in danger of passing his whole life
[10:18 --> 10:21] without ever tasting military glory and was
[10:21 --> 10:23] determined to rectify that situation.
[10:24 --> 10:27] Mucianus saw in the mild, capable, and well
[10:27 --> 10:30] like Vespasian the perfect vehicle for his
[10:30 --> 10:30] ambitions.
[10:31 --> 10:34] So he became an early prodder of Vespasian's
[10:34 --> 10:36] growing ego and an active supporter once the
[10:36 --> 10:39] future emperor finally decided to go for it.
[10:40 --> 10:42] The other key prodder of Vespasian was
[10:42 --> 10:45] Tiberius Julius Alexander, the Jewish born
[10:45 --> 10:46] prefect of Egypt.
[10:47 --> 10:50] Appointed by Nero, events in the west had
[10:50 --> 10:53] unfolded too rapidly for either Galba or Otho
[10:53 --> 10:54] to replace him.
[10:54 --> 10:56] So he and his two legions continued their
[10:56 --> 10:59] administration in Alexandria well into
[10:59 --> 11:00] Vitellius's reign.
[11:01 --> 11:03] Having no love for Vitellius and knowing
[11:03 --> 11:05] full well that the new emperor would likely
[11:05 --> 11:08] replace him and possibly execute him at the
[11:08 --> 11:11] first opportunity, Alexander began a secret
[11:11 --> 11:13] correspondence with Vespasian, pledging his
[11:13 --> 11:16] support and his legions if Vespasian decided
[11:16 --> 11:18] to, you know, do something.
[11:19 --> 11:21] The two legions were nice, but the real
[11:21 --> 11:23] prize here was that Egypt was still a key
[11:23 --> 11:25] agricultural engine of the empire.
[11:26 --> 11:28] Any invasion of Italy that was coupled with
[11:28 --> 11:31] a strangling off of the grain supply did not
[11:31 --> 11:34] necessarily guarantee victory, see Antony,
[11:34 --> 11:37] Mark, but it sure upped the percentages by a
[11:37 --> 11:38] healthy margin.
[11:40 --> 11:43] Both Mucianus and Alexander were ready to
[11:43 --> 11:45] declare for Vespasian immediately, but the
[11:45 --> 11:48] future emperor was a deliberate man, and as
[11:48 --> 11:50] spring turned to summer, he had still not
[11:50 --> 11:52] yet announced whether or not he was going to
[11:52 --> 11:54] lead the armies of the east in revolt.
[11:55 --> 11:58] The impatient Alexander decided Vespasian just
[11:58 --> 12:00] needed a swift kick to get going, so the
[12:00 --> 12:02] prefect of Egypt went ahead and administered
[12:02 --> 12:04] an oath of loyalty to Vespasian to his
[12:04 --> 12:07] legions on July the 1st.
[12:07 --> 12:09] A few days later, Vespasian's armies in
[12:09 --> 12:11] Judea heard the news, and when their general
[12:11 --> 12:14] emerged from his tent, a collection of them
[12:14 --> 12:15] casually hailed him as emperor.
[12:16 --> 12:18] With the cat now out of the bag, Vespasian
[12:18 --> 12:20] decided to let it roam free.
[12:21 --> 12:24] On July 15, Mucianus administered the
[12:24 --> 12:26] oath to the legions of Syria and went to
[12:26 --> 12:28] work convincing the legions and the
[12:28 --> 12:29] Balkans to join them.
[12:30 --> 12:31] In the process of being punished by
[12:31 --> 12:34] Vitellius for their support of Otho, the
[12:34 --> 12:35] troops and the Balkans were more than
[12:35 --> 12:37] happy to join in the fight.
[12:38 --> 12:40] In short order, Vespasian had the whole of
[12:40 --> 12:42] the eastern empire lined up behind him.
[12:43 --> 12:45] Vitellius, meanwhile, was still taking his
[12:45 --> 12:46] victory lap.
[12:48 --> 12:51] The Flavian plan was for Vespasian to
[12:51 --> 12:53] remain behind in the east while Mucianus
[12:53 --> 12:55] led an invasion of the west.
[12:55 --> 12:58] Taking up residence in Alexandria, Vespasian
[12:58 --> 13:00] would be able to personally oversee the
[13:00 --> 13:02] all-important province of Egypt while
[13:02 --> 13:04] remaining perfectly situated to reinforce
[13:04 --> 13:06] his invasion force should they need
[13:06 --> 13:07] support.
[13:08 --> 13:10] After receiving assurances from the
[13:10 --> 13:11] Parthians that they would not stir up
[13:11 --> 13:13] trouble along the border, Mucianus set
[13:13 --> 13:16] out west with a force of about 18,000
[13:16 --> 13:16] troops.
[13:17 --> 13:19] Along the way, he was supposed to pick
[13:19 --> 13:21] up the Balkan legions and then, when
[13:21 --> 13:23] he got near Italy, put out the call to
[13:23 --> 13:25] the demobilized Othonian troops to
[13:25 --> 13:27] flock to Vespasian's banner.
[13:28 --> 13:30] But things did not exactly go
[13:30 --> 13:31] according to plan.
[13:33 --> 13:34] The commanders of the five legions
[13:34 --> 13:36] stationed in the Balkans were eager to
[13:36 --> 13:38] take their revenge on Vitellius, but
[13:38 --> 13:41] not as eager as the troops themselves.
[13:42 --> 13:44] The officers stated flatly that the
[13:44 --> 13:46] plan was to wait for Mucianus, so
[13:46 --> 13:48] that's what they were going to do.
[13:49 --> 13:51] Seeing an opportunity to bathe himself
[13:51 --> 13:54] in glory though, Marcus Antonius Primus
[13:54 --> 13:56] broke with his colleagues and argued
[13:56 --> 13:58] that they should immediately invade Italy
[13:58 --> 13:59] while the Vitellian troops were still
[13:59 --> 14:00] drunk with victory.
[14:01 --> 14:03] The troops couldn't have agreed more and
[14:03 --> 14:05] elected Antonius their new general.
[14:06 --> 14:08] Instead of waiting for Mucianus to
[14:08 --> 14:10] arrive, Antonius went off the
[14:10 --> 14:12] reservation and led the legions now
[14:12 --> 14:13] under his command into Italy.
[14:14 --> 14:16] In other words, the army that
[14:16 --> 14:18] ultimately won the war for Vespasian
[14:18 --> 14:20] was never authorized to do what it
[14:20 --> 14:21] did.
[14:23 --> 14:24] When Vitellius learned that a Flavian
[14:24 --> 14:26] army was marching on Italy, he
[14:27 --> 14:29] dispatched Kysena to stop their advance.
[14:30 --> 14:31] The emperor no doubt would have sent
[14:31 --> 14:33] Valens as well, but the elder general
[14:33 --> 14:35] was recovering from an illness at the
[14:35 --> 14:37] time and was unable to make the trip.
[14:38 --> 14:41] For Kysena, this presented a golden
[14:41 --> 14:41] opportunity.
[14:42 --> 14:44] In the months since he had helped
[14:44 --> 14:46] Vitellius become emperor, the young
[14:46 --> 14:48] noble had found himself increasingly
[14:48 --> 14:50] ignored while Valens emerged as the
[14:50 --> 14:52] far more influential advisor.
[14:53 --> 14:55] Whenever Valens and Kysena disagreed
[14:55 --> 14:57] over some issue or another, Vitellius
[14:57 --> 14:58] generally backed Valens.
[15:00 --> 15:01] Deeply unhappy with his position,
[15:02 --> 15:03] Kysena marched north at the head of
[15:03 --> 15:05] the Vitellian legions, thinking
[15:05 --> 15:07] deeply not about battle plans, but
[15:07 --> 15:09] whether or not he should defect to
[15:09 --> 15:09] Vespasian.
[15:11 --> 15:12] He had already been in contact with
[15:12 --> 15:14] the commander of the Vitellian naval
[15:14 --> 15:16] fleet stationed at Ravenna, and the
[15:16 --> 15:18] commander there had assured Kysena
[15:18 --> 15:19] that he was going over to Vespasian
[15:19 --> 15:21] at the first opportunity.
[15:21 --> 15:24] Kysena, he said, should join him on
[15:24 --> 15:25] the winning team.
[15:26 --> 15:28] Antonius arrived in Italy with his
[15:28 --> 15:30] advance guard in October, and was
[15:30 --> 15:32] greeted by a much stronger force led
[15:32 --> 15:33] by Kysena.
[15:34 --> 15:35] But rather than attack as his men
[15:35 --> 15:38] expected, Kysena opened negotiations
[15:38 --> 15:40] with Antonius, hinting elliptically
[15:40 --> 15:41] that he was willing to betray
[15:41 --> 15:43] Vitellius if the terms were right.
[15:45 --> 15:46] While he negotiated, the rest of
[15:46 --> 15:48] Antonius' troops arrived, negating
[15:48 --> 15:50] the numerical advantage that the
[15:50 --> 15:52] Vitellians had once had, leading
[15:52 --> 15:54] the men under Kysena's command to
[15:54 --> 15:55] wonder just what their general was
[15:55 --> 15:56] up to.
[15:57 --> 15:58] Not long after that, though, they
[15:58 --> 15:59] got their answer.
[16:00 --> 16:02] Messengers arrived with the news
[16:02 --> 16:03] that the Ravenna fleet had
[16:03 --> 16:04] defected to Vespasian.
[16:05 --> 16:06] Kysena called together his
[16:06 --> 16:08] officers and announced that it
[16:08 --> 16:09] was hopeless to fight the
[16:09 --> 16:10] Flavian onslaught.
[16:11 --> 16:12] The whole empire was turning
[16:12 --> 16:14] against Vitellius, and they had
[16:14 --> 16:15] better join the winning side
[16:15 --> 16:16] before they all found their heads
[16:16 --> 16:17] on the chopping block.
[16:19 --> 16:20] He managed to convince the
[16:20 --> 16:21] officers, but when the regular
[16:21 --> 16:23] troops learned of the betrayal,
[16:23 --> 16:25] they stormed the tent and threw
[16:25 --> 16:27] the shocked and sputtering Kysena
[16:27 --> 16:27] into chains.
[16:28 --> 16:30] The men elected new generals and
[16:30 --> 16:31] abandoned the position they had
[16:31 --> 16:33] held near Antonius' base in
[16:33 --> 16:34] Verona.
[16:35 --> 16:36] Antonius woke up the next
[16:36 --> 16:38] morning and discovered the army
[16:38 --> 16:39] he thought was about to join
[16:39 --> 16:41] him had suddenly disappeared
[16:41 --> 16:41] into the night.
[16:43 --> 16:44] But not one to delay,
[16:44 --> 16:45] Antonius marched straight away
[16:45 --> 16:47] for Bedriacum, where he planned
[16:47 --> 16:48] to make a camp from which to
[16:48 --> 16:50] launch an assault on Cremona,
[16:50 --> 16:51] the Vitellian base of
[16:51 --> 16:53] operations in North Italy.
[16:54 --> 16:55] Kysena's army had already made
[16:55 --> 16:56] for Cremona following their
[16:56 --> 16:58] generals' aborted defection,
[16:58 --> 17:00] and now waited nervously for
[17:00 --> 17:01] Antonius to arrive.
[17:02 --> 17:03] In a few days, the two sides
[17:03 --> 17:05] would meet in one of the
[17:05 --> 17:06] rarest sights in the ancient
[17:06 --> 17:08] world, a night battle.
[17:10 --> 17:11] Marching in from the east on
[17:11 --> 17:12] October the 24th,
[17:13 --> 17:14] Antonius' army was disrupted
[17:14 --> 17:16] by a Vitellian cavalry attack
[17:16 --> 17:18] and a brief skirmish ensued
[17:18 --> 17:19] that saw the Vitellians
[17:19 --> 17:20] driven off.
[17:20 --> 17:22] The Flavian army kept marching,
[17:22 --> 17:24] but they were unable to reach
[17:24 --> 17:25] the full Vitellian force
[17:25 --> 17:27] until late in the afternoon.
[17:28 --> 17:29] Flushed with victory,
[17:29 --> 17:31] the Flavians refused to retire
[17:31 --> 17:31] from the field.
[17:32 --> 17:33] For their part,
[17:33 --> 17:35] the Vitellians were so close
[17:35 --> 17:36] to the safety of Cremona
[17:36 --> 17:37] that they figured that if
[17:37 --> 17:38] things got too hairy,
[17:38 --> 17:39] they could just make a run
[17:39 --> 17:41] for it, so they too refused
[17:41 --> 17:42] to retire for the evening.
[17:44 --> 17:45] For the next 10 hours,
[17:45 --> 17:46] the two armies fought a
[17:46 --> 17:48] sporadic and bloody battle
[17:48 --> 17:49] through the night that was
[17:49 --> 17:50] still undecided when the sun
[17:50 --> 17:52] rose the next morning.
[17:53 --> 17:54] In a quirky twist of fate,
[17:55 --> 17:56] though, the Vitellians lost
[17:56 --> 17:57] heart when they saw one
[17:57 --> 17:58] of the Flavian legions
[17:58 --> 18:00] turn east and clearly greet
[18:00 --> 18:02] the arrival of reinforcements.
[18:03 --> 18:04] Exhausted from the battle,
[18:04 --> 18:06] the Vitellians fled back
[18:06 --> 18:07] to the safety of Cremona
[18:07 --> 18:08] to wait for their own
[18:09 --> 18:09] reinforcements,
[18:09 --> 18:11] except that there were no
[18:11 --> 18:12] Flavian reinforcements.
[18:13 --> 18:14] Having spent years stationed
[18:14 --> 18:15] in the east,
[18:15 --> 18:16] the legion in question
[18:16 --> 18:18] had adopted a local custom
[18:18 --> 18:19] of greeting the sun
[18:19 --> 18:20] as it rose each morning.
[18:21 --> 18:22] At the second battle
[18:22 --> 18:22] of Bedriacum,
[18:23 --> 18:24] the Vitellians were finally
[18:24 --> 18:25] defeated not by force,
[18:26 --> 18:27] but by a completely harmless
[18:27 --> 18:28] religious ritual.
[18:30 --> 18:32] Despite their own exhaustion,
[18:32 --> 18:33] Antonius's army closed
[18:33 --> 18:35] the last few miles to Cremona
[18:35 --> 18:36] and laid siege to the city
[18:36 --> 18:37] that morning.
[18:38 --> 18:39] First, they destroyed
[18:39 --> 18:40] the Vitellian camp
[18:40 --> 18:41] outside the walls,
[18:41 --> 18:42] and then they launched
[18:42 --> 18:43] a ferocious assault
[18:43 --> 18:44] on the city itself.
[18:45 --> 18:46] While the troops and citizens
[18:46 --> 18:47] of the city fought off
[18:47 --> 18:49] the attack, the officers
[18:49 --> 18:50] of the Vitellian army
[18:50 --> 18:51] lost hope.
[18:52 --> 18:54] They set Kaisina loose
[18:54 --> 18:55] and begged him to negotiate
[18:55 --> 18:56] a peace that would spare
[18:56 --> 18:57] their lives.
[18:58 --> 18:59] With the leadership
[18:59 --> 19:00] of the army protecting them
[19:00 --> 19:00] giving up,
[19:01 --> 19:02] the civilian leadership
[19:02 --> 19:02] of Cremona
[19:02 --> 19:04] opened their own talks,
[19:04 --> 19:05] and in short order,
[19:05 --> 19:07] both the Vitellian legions
[19:07 --> 19:08] and the people of Cremona
[19:08 --> 19:09] emerged from the city
[19:09 --> 19:10] to stand before
[19:10 --> 19:12] the victorious Flavians.
[19:13 --> 19:14] It was supposed to be
[19:14 --> 19:15] a peaceful settlement,
[19:15 --> 19:16] one with no sacking,
[19:16 --> 19:18] but the tired, bloody,
[19:19 --> 19:20] and angry Flavian troops
[19:20 --> 19:21] were in no mood
[19:21 --> 19:22] to be denied the loot
[19:22 --> 19:24] they saw as rightfully theirs.
[19:25 --> 19:26] They believed that they had been
[19:26 --> 19:28] promised Cremona as a prize
[19:28 --> 19:29] for the extreme effort
[19:29 --> 19:30] they had just expended
[19:30 --> 19:31] in taking it,
[19:31 --> 19:33] but it seemed that the officers
[19:33 --> 19:34] were now conspiring
[19:34 --> 19:36] to deny them their prize.
[19:37 --> 19:38] So when Antonius entered
[19:38 --> 19:40] the city to take a hot bath,
[19:40 --> 19:41] his absence allowed
[19:41 --> 19:43] the restraint of his army
[19:43 --> 19:43] to slip.
[19:44 --> 19:45] Forty thousand troops
[19:45 --> 19:46] poured into Cremona,
[19:47 --> 19:47] grabbing anything
[19:47 --> 19:49] that wasn't nailed down
[19:49 --> 19:50] and setting fire to the rest.
[19:51 --> 19:52] When Vespasian learned
[19:52 --> 19:53] what had happened,
[19:53 --> 19:54] he denounced the actions
[19:54 --> 19:56] of Antonius' army,
[19:56 --> 19:56] and as emperor,
[19:57 --> 19:58] he tried to rebuild the city,
[19:59 --> 19:59] but it would never again
[19:59 --> 20:00] rise to the prominence
[20:00 --> 20:02] it had enjoyed since its founding
[20:02 --> 20:04] just before the Second Punic War.
[20:06 --> 20:07] The battle may not have marked
[20:07 --> 20:09] the official end of the war,
[20:09 --> 20:10] but it certainly dealt
[20:10 --> 20:11] a heavy blow
[20:11 --> 20:12] to Vitellius' chances.
[20:13 --> 20:15] From this point on,
[20:15 --> 20:16] practically everything pointed
[20:16 --> 20:19] to an emperor destined to fall.
[20:20 --> 20:21] Valens had been ordered north
[20:21 --> 20:22] about a week
[20:22 --> 20:23] after Cicena's departure,
[20:24 --> 20:25] but his sluggish pace
[20:25 --> 20:27] left him far from Cremona
[20:27 --> 20:28] when he learned first
[20:28 --> 20:29] of Cicena's attempt
[20:29 --> 20:29] to defection
[20:29 --> 20:30] and then the sack
[20:30 --> 20:31] of the city itself.
[20:33 --> 20:34] He changed direction
[20:34 --> 20:35] and tried to make for Gaul,
[20:35 --> 20:36] where he would be able
[20:36 --> 20:37] to raise reinforcements.
[20:37 --> 20:38] But by this point,
[20:39 --> 20:40] practically every governor
[20:40 --> 20:41] in the area was pledging
[20:41 --> 20:42] allegiance to Vespasian.
[20:43 --> 20:45] Valens was captured at sea
[20:45 --> 20:46] by former members
[20:46 --> 20:47] of Othos Praetorian Guard
[20:47 --> 20:49] and then sent along to Antonius
[20:49 --> 20:51] as a gift wrap present.
[20:52 --> 20:53] Soon enough,
[20:53 --> 20:54] Valens' head would be waved
[20:54 --> 20:56] before the Vitellian troops
[20:56 --> 20:57] as proof that further
[20:57 --> 21:00] resistance was futile.
[21:01 --> 21:01] Cicena and Valens
[21:01 --> 21:03] had been the driving force
[21:03 --> 21:05] behind Vitellius' bid for power,
[21:05 --> 21:06] and now one of them
[21:06 --> 21:07] had turned on him
[21:07 --> 21:08] and the other was dead.
[21:09 --> 21:10] The emperor did not know
[21:10 --> 21:11] what to do.
[21:12 --> 21:14] He marched out of Rome
[21:14 --> 21:15] with most of his new Praetorian
[21:15 --> 21:16] guard to make a stand,
[21:17 --> 21:18] but upon hearing about
[21:18 --> 21:18] more defections
[21:18 --> 21:19] throughout the empire,
[21:20 --> 21:21] he returned to Rome
[21:21 --> 21:22] with half the troops
[21:22 --> 21:23] at his disposal,
[21:23 --> 21:24] leaving the rest in place
[21:24 --> 21:26] to halt the advance of Antonius.
[21:27 --> 21:29] As the Flavian army marched
[21:29 --> 21:30] south, both Mucianus
[21:30 --> 21:32] and Antonius opened up
[21:32 --> 21:33] correspondence with Vitellius
[21:33 --> 21:35] in an attempt to secure
[21:35 --> 21:36] his abdication.
[21:37 --> 21:38] They promised him his life,
[21:39 --> 21:40] money, and a villain
[21:40 --> 21:41] Campania if he agreed
[21:41 --> 21:43] to give up the throne willingly.
[21:44 --> 21:46] Vitellius, in way over his head,
[21:46 --> 21:48] was eager for the opportunity
[21:48 --> 21:49] to get out of all of this
[21:49 --> 21:50] with his life.
[21:50 --> 21:52] So he took up negotiations
[21:52 --> 21:53] with Vespasian's brother,
[21:53 --> 21:54] Flavius Sabinus,
[21:54 --> 21:55] who was living in Rome
[21:55 --> 21:56] at the time.
[21:57 --> 21:58] But Vitellius' attempt
[21:58 --> 22:00] to abdicate was thwarted
[22:00 --> 22:01] by his own supporters.
[22:02 --> 22:03] On December 18,
[22:03 --> 22:05] the emperor gave a speech
[22:05 --> 22:05] announcing that he was
[22:05 --> 22:06] stepping down,
[22:07 --> 22:08] much to the dismay
[22:08 --> 22:09] of the loyal troops
[22:09 --> 22:10] he still had with him.
[22:11 --> 22:12] They had all staked their lives
[22:12 --> 22:13] to this man,
[22:13 --> 22:14] and now he was simply
[22:14 --> 22:15] going to give up.
[22:16 --> 22:17] Where did that leave them?
[22:18 --> 22:20] So as Vitellius attempted
[22:20 --> 22:20] to leave the Forum,
[22:21 --> 22:22] he was boxed in by members
[22:22 --> 22:23] of his own praetorian guard
[22:23 --> 22:25] and marched back to the palace,
[22:25 --> 22:27] his resignation annulled
[22:27 --> 22:28] by the tip of a spear.
[22:31 --> 22:32] Sabinus was at home
[22:32 --> 22:33] when he heard of Vitellius'
[22:33 --> 22:34] attempted resignation,
[22:34 --> 22:36] and he immediately headed down
[22:36 --> 22:37] to the Forum with an armed guard
[22:37 --> 22:39] to issue a proclamation
[22:39 --> 22:40] in his brother's name.
[22:41 --> 22:42] But along the way,
[22:42 --> 22:43] he was surprised to find
[22:43 --> 22:45] the Vitellians had not,
[22:45 --> 22:46] in fact, given up.
[22:47 --> 22:48] A brief skirmish broke out
[22:48 --> 22:49] and Sabinus was driven up
[22:49 --> 22:51] onto the Capitoline Hill,
[22:51 --> 22:52] where he and his men
[22:52 --> 22:53] barricaded themselves.
[22:54 --> 22:55] Over the course of a night
[22:55 --> 22:56] and a day,
[22:56 --> 22:57] the Vitellian forces
[22:57 --> 22:58] attempted to dislodge
[22:58 --> 22:59] Sabinus,
[22:59 --> 23:00] and in the process,
[23:00 --> 23:01] the Temple of Jupiter,
[23:01 --> 23:02] one of the most important
[23:02 --> 23:03] temples in Rome,
[23:04 --> 23:05] was burned to the ground.
[23:06 --> 23:07] With the fire raging,
[23:07 --> 23:08] the men who had surrounded
[23:08 --> 23:10] Sabinus deserted him,
[23:10 --> 23:10] and he was eventually
[23:10 --> 23:12] captured by the Vitellians
[23:12 --> 23:12] and executed.
[23:15 --> 23:17] The execution of Vespasian's
[23:17 --> 23:18] brother precluded
[23:18 --> 23:19] all future negotiations.
[23:20 --> 23:21] The army of Antonius,
[23:22 --> 23:23] now only miles from Rome,
[23:23 --> 23:24] learned of the incident
[23:24 --> 23:25] and made straightaway
[23:25 --> 23:26] for the city.
[23:27 --> 23:28] At first,
[23:28 --> 23:29] Antonius hesitated,
[23:30 --> 23:31] understandably nervous,
[23:31 --> 23:32] that attacking Rome itself
[23:32 --> 23:34] would irreparably damage
[23:34 --> 23:36] Vespasian's and his own
[23:36 --> 23:36] reputation,
[23:36 --> 23:37] to the point that even
[23:37 --> 23:39] a victory would be a defeat.
[23:40 --> 23:41] But his men convinced him
[23:41 --> 23:42] that they ought not
[23:42 --> 23:43] balk now that the empire
[23:43 --> 23:44] was in their hands.
[23:46 --> 23:47] Antonius divided his army
[23:47 --> 23:47] into thirds
[23:47 --> 23:49] and attacked at three
[23:49 --> 23:49] different gates.
[23:50 --> 23:51] Two of the gates
[23:51 --> 23:52] were easily breached,
[23:52 --> 23:53] as they were only guarded
[23:53 --> 23:54] by an untrained mix
[23:54 --> 23:56] of civilian militia.
[23:56 --> 23:57] But the fighting at the
[23:57 --> 23:59] coal line gate was intense.
[24:00 --> 24:01] The outnumbered Vitellians
[24:01 --> 24:02] were eventually pressed back
[24:02 --> 24:03] and forced to make
[24:03 --> 24:04] a last stand within
[24:04 --> 24:05] the Praetorian camp.
[24:05 --> 24:07] But despite heavy casualties,
[24:08 --> 24:09] the Vitellians finally
[24:09 --> 24:09] breached the walls,
[24:10 --> 24:11] led by the former members
[24:11 --> 24:12] of Otho's Praetorian Guard,
[24:13 --> 24:14] who viewed reclaiming the camp
[24:14 --> 24:16] as a matter of personal honor.
[24:18 --> 24:20] Vitellius was now all alone.
[24:20 --> 24:21] His attempt to give up
[24:21 --> 24:22] had failed,
[24:22 --> 24:23] and he wandered
[24:23 --> 24:24] the deserted imperial palace
[24:24 --> 24:25] in shock,
[24:25 --> 24:26] trying to figure out
[24:26 --> 24:27] what to do next.
[24:28 --> 24:29] Eventually,
[24:29 --> 24:30] the incoming Vitellian army
[24:30 --> 24:31] stumbled upon him
[24:31 --> 24:32] and took him prisoner.
[24:33 --> 24:34] They marched him
[24:34 --> 24:35] blubbering through the streets
[24:35 --> 24:36] to the steps of lamentation,
[24:37 --> 24:38] where he was unceremoniously
[24:38 --> 24:40] beheaded as insults
[24:40 --> 24:41] rained down upon him.
[24:42 --> 24:43] His head was paraded
[24:43 --> 24:44] through the city as a trophy,
[24:44 --> 24:45] and his body thrown
[24:45 --> 24:46] in the Tiber.
[24:48 --> 24:49] Vitellius was 54 years old
[24:49 --> 24:50] when he died,
[24:50 --> 24:51] and had reigned for just
[24:51 --> 24:52] over nine months.
[24:53 --> 24:54] His death would bring
[24:54 --> 24:55] a violent close
[24:55 --> 24:57] to a violent year.
[24:57 --> 24:59] On the 20th of September,
[24:59 --> 25:00] the Senate met
[25:00 --> 25:01] and unanimously declared
[25:01 --> 25:02] Vespasian emperor.
[25:03 --> 25:05] It would be understandable
[25:05 --> 25:06] if the no doubt
[25:06 --> 25:08] skittish citizens of the empire
[25:08 --> 25:09] were a bit skeptical
[25:09 --> 25:10] that this really was
[25:10 --> 25:11] an end to the chaos.
[25:12 --> 25:13] But as the months
[25:13 --> 25:14] passed into years,
[25:14 --> 25:15] and no other pretender
[25:15 --> 25:16] to the throne arose,
[25:16 --> 25:17] they began to get comfortable
[25:17 --> 25:18] with the idea
[25:18 --> 25:20] that things had sort of
[25:20 --> 25:21] returned to normal,
[25:21 --> 25:22] that they could fully embrace
[25:22 --> 25:23] this new dynasty,
[25:24 --> 25:25] the Flavian dynasty.
[25:29 --> 25:30] Before we go this week,
[25:30 --> 25:31] I just want to mention
[25:31 --> 25:32] that Lars Brownworth,
[25:32 --> 25:33] whose book I just
[25:33 --> 25:34] recommended you buy,
[25:35 --> 25:36] is in the process
[25:36 --> 25:37] of gauging interest
[25:37 --> 25:38] for a lecture tour
[25:38 --> 25:39] in early 2010.
[25:40 --> 25:41] Since we have so many listeners
[25:41 --> 25:42] in common,
[25:42 --> 25:43] they've asked me to ask you
[25:43 --> 25:45] if anyone in and around
[25:45 --> 25:47] Boston, New York,
[25:47 --> 25:49] Washington DC, Chicago,
[25:49 --> 25:50] and San Francisco
[25:50 --> 25:51] would be interested
[25:51 --> 25:52] in such a thing.
[25:52 --> 25:53] I'm also going to add
[25:53 --> 25:55] Austin, Texas to the list
[25:55 --> 25:56] because that's where I live now
[25:56 --> 25:58] and I think he should come
[25:58 --> 25:58] down here.
[25:59 --> 26:00] I'll post some links
[26:00 --> 26:02] at thehistoryofroham.typepad.com
[26:02 --> 26:04] so that you can either
[26:04 --> 26:05] email superfan Detlef
[26:05 --> 26:06] with your thoughts
[26:06 --> 26:07] or sound off
[26:07 --> 26:09] at the Forum Galorum,
[26:09 --> 26:10] the discussion community
[26:10 --> 26:11] for the history of Rome
[26:11 --> 26:13] that Detlef has set up.

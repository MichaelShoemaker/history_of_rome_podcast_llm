[00:04 --> 00:12] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, Episode 26, The Third Macedonian War.
[00:13 --> 00:18] Having soundly beaten Macedon and Syria, the last two major powers in the East, Rome
[00:18 --> 00:23] was now the dominant force in the Mediterranean, a distinction it would hold for the next
[00:23 --> 00:24] 700 odd years.
[00:25 --> 00:29] In the years after the Syrian War, the Romans were wrapped up with Gallic revolts
[00:29 --> 00:32] in the Po Valley and persistent unrest in Spain.
[00:33 --> 00:37] Though these territories had been officially conquered, the Romans found it as difficult
[00:37 --> 00:42] to maintain their position in these territories as it had been to establish it in the first
[00:42 --> 00:42] place.
[00:43 --> 00:48] But for the most part, these were mere skirmishes in the wider scope of Mediterranean
[00:48 --> 00:48] politics.
[00:49 --> 00:55] The real center of attention remained Greece, where, like in Spain and Gaul, winning
[00:55 --> 00:57] the prize was not the same as keeping the prize.
[00:58 --> 01:03] Yes, the Romans had demonstrated the superiority of their arms, and even the superiority
[01:03 --> 01:08] of their diplomatic corps, but the fiercely independent Greeks would never passively
[01:08 --> 01:12] stand by as a foreign power held final say over their lives.
[01:14 --> 01:18] Rome had its allies, most notably the Kingdom of Pergamum in Asia Minor, but
[01:18 --> 01:22] the majority of Greeks bristled at the presence of the barbarians from the West.
[01:23 --> 01:28] Factions of nobles in most of the important cities schemed constantly to carve out as
[01:28 --> 01:32] much autonomy as they could, with an eye on eventually throwing off the Roman yoke.
[01:33 --> 01:37] Greece was, after all, the oldest and greatest civilization on earth.
[01:37 --> 01:42] Surely Roman rule was merely temporary, and in time the Greeks would retake their
[01:42 --> 01:44] place as the leaders of civilization, right?
[01:47 --> 01:52] In Macedon, Philip V had been put squarely in his place, and for all his pride and
[01:52 --> 01:57] ambition, he was able to do little about his sorry state after being defeated at
[01:57 --> 01:57] Cynicephaly.
[01:58 --> 02:02] Though he hated Rome, he was a broken man who could not muster the energy for a
[02:02 --> 02:03] full-scale revolt.
[02:04 --> 02:08] That task would be left to his son, who would return the bravado and swagger
[02:08 --> 02:12] to Macedon and renew their quest to drive the Italians from Greece forever.
[02:14 --> 02:19] The catalyst of the Third Macedonian War was Philip V's death in 179 BC,
[02:19 --> 02:24] which was, by all accounts, directly related to a quarrel between his two sons,
[02:25 --> 02:26] Perseus and Demetrius.
[02:28 --> 02:32] After the peace between Macedon and Rome, young Demetrius, Philip's second son,
[02:32 --> 02:34] had been sent to Rome as a hostage.
[02:35 --> 02:39] Years spent in the city had left the young prince with a pro-Roman world view.
[02:39 --> 02:43] Perseus feared that the political leanings of his younger brother would manifest upon
[02:43 --> 02:48] their father's death, that Rome would engineer a coup, and Perseus would be
[02:48 --> 02:52] denied his rightful throne, while Demetrius ruled the puppet kingdom for Rome.
[02:53 --> 02:58] So, when Demetrius returned to Macedon in 180 BC, Perseus moved quickly against
[02:58 --> 03:02] his brother, convincing Philip that Demetrius was guilty of treason and was
[03:02 --> 03:04] plotting with Rome to install himself as king.
[03:06 --> 03:10] Philip allowed himself to be swayed and reluctantly ordered the execution of
[03:10 --> 03:10] his son.
[03:11 --> 03:15] Despite his belief that he had no choice, Philip never recovered from
[03:15 --> 03:19] Demetrius' death, and within a year the old king was dead.
[03:21 --> 03:25] This left Perseus in control and Rome concerned about their eastern flank.
[03:26 --> 03:30] The Macedonian king kept testing Roman patience, clearly violating the treaty
[03:30 --> 03:34] his father had signed by taking control of neighboring territory outside
[03:34 --> 03:38] Macedon proper and opening diplomatic relations with the Greek political
[03:38 --> 03:39] syndicates.
[03:40 --> 03:44] Most worrisome to Rome, Perseus arranged marriage to the daughter of
[03:44 --> 03:48] Lucius IV, who had succeeded his father Antiochus the Great as king of
[03:48 --> 03:49] Syria.
[03:50 --> 03:54] The Senate hoped for the best, though, and, weary of war and unwilling
[03:54 --> 03:58] to embrace a belligerent stance, they turned a blind eye to Perseus'
[03:58 --> 03:59] actions.
[04:00 --> 04:04] The alliance between the two great Greek powers was a cause of concern
[04:04 --> 04:08] in the Senate, but even more so for the kingdom of Pergamum, Rome's
[04:08 --> 04:12] steadfast ally, whose territory bordered both Syria and Macedon.
[04:13 --> 04:17] Envoys from Pergamum began to send dispatches detailing the outrages and
[04:17 --> 04:21] offenses of Perseus, begging Rome to do something about the young upstart
[04:21 --> 04:23] king of Macedon.
[04:24 --> 04:27] Rome ignored the threat for as long as they could, but finally Illyria
[04:27 --> 04:31] began to rise in revolt against Rome, and the common belief was that
[04:31 --> 04:33] Perseus was behind the violence.
[04:34 --> 04:37] That, coupled with an assassination attempt against the king of Pergamum,
[04:37 --> 04:43] sealed the deal, and in 172 BC, legions were sent back across the Adriatic.
[04:45 --> 04:48] At first, the Romans simply moved into Illyria to quell the uprising
[04:48 --> 04:53] and stood on the border of Macedon, but a year later, war was
[04:53 --> 04:56] officially declared and the legions headed into Macedon under the
[04:56 --> 05:00] command of Licinius Crassus, an ancestor of the famous Triumvir, who
[05:00 --> 05:04] would join with Julius Caesar and Pompey in their fatal three-way
[05:04 --> 05:05] alliance a century later.
[05:06 --> 05:10] This Crassus did not get his familial legacy off to a great start and
[05:10 --> 05:13] promptly led the Romans to their first defeat in Greece.
[05:14 --> 05:18] It was a minor engagement to be sure, but the propaganda value of the
[05:18 --> 05:21] loss was a boon to Perseus, and Greek leaders who had kept their
[05:21 --> 05:24] distance from an open conflict with Rome began to throw their
[05:24 --> 05:25] support to Macedon.
[05:26 --> 05:29] It was a decision that would haunt a lot of them and lead not to
[05:29 --> 05:32] freedom, but to the obliteration of freedom.
[05:34 --> 05:37] After direct confrontation with the Macedonians had proved to be more
[05:37 --> 05:41] difficult than the Romans thought, the next two years saw the
[05:41 --> 05:44] Roman army in the east turn toward more profitable and less
[05:44 --> 05:48] dangerous pursuits, the plunder of defenseless Greek towns.
[05:50 --> 05:53] The consuls in charge during these two years seemed to have
[05:53 --> 05:57] had little ability or desire to control their men and the
[05:57 --> 05:59] legions became little more than a highly efficient band of
[05:59 --> 06:00] marauders.
[06:01 --> 06:05] A great deal of wealth, plunder, and slaves were hauled back to Rome.
[06:06 --> 06:08] Everyone profited, so discipline went out the window.
[06:09 --> 06:13] This, coupled with the behind the scenes maneuvering of Perseus,
[06:13 --> 06:15] turned even more Greeks against Rome.
[06:16 --> 06:18] There was little to be gained by standing with the Romans now.
[06:19 --> 06:22] The Italian brutes had no interest in governing, or indeed,
[06:23 --> 06:24] the lives of Greeks in general.
[06:25 --> 06:26] They just wanted to ransack the countryside.
[06:28 --> 06:33] In 168 BC, the new consul for the year was Aemilius Paulus,
[06:34 --> 06:36] the son of the Paulus who had tried to halt the battle of
[06:36 --> 06:39] Cannae before it happened, and then died leading his troops
[06:39 --> 06:40] into the massacre.
[06:41 --> 06:44] More disciplined than the previous consuls, Paulus the
[06:44 --> 06:47] younger immediately restored a sense of purpose to the
[06:47 --> 06:49] troops, reminding them that they were there to fight as
[06:49 --> 06:52] soldiers against an army, not a thief from innocent
[06:52 --> 06:56] Greeks, who were, after all, nominally under Roman
[06:56 --> 06:59] protection, if that was not a complete contradiction in
[06:59 --> 07:00] terms by now.
[07:01 --> 07:03] Paulus located the army of Perseus and announced his
[07:03 --> 07:06] intention to make for the Macedonian army and defeat
[07:06 --> 07:07] them.
[07:09 --> 07:12] Perseus was well positioned with 40,000 troops on the
[07:12 --> 07:14] Aegean coast, and dislodging him would take
[07:14 --> 07:14] some doing.
[07:15 --> 07:18] Paulus ordered one of his generals to take a chunk of
[07:18 --> 07:20] the army and make a lot of noise approaching
[07:20 --> 07:21] Perseus from the north.
[07:22 --> 07:25] This maneuver convinced the Macedonians that the main
[07:25 --> 07:28] Roman army would follow, and they prepared for an
[07:28 --> 07:29] invasion from the north.
[07:30 --> 07:33] However, as soon as darkness fell, the Roman
[07:33 --> 07:36] expeditionary force kept right on walking and swung
[07:36 --> 07:37] around behind the Greeks.
[07:38 --> 07:40] Only the timely intervention of a Roman deserter
[07:40 --> 07:42] alerted Perseus to the danger.
[07:43 --> 07:45] 12,000 Greeks were sent down to block the Romans
[07:45 --> 07:48] coming up now from the south, but they were driven
[07:48 --> 07:50] back in disarray.
[07:50 --> 07:53] Realizing he was being encircled and unsure of
[07:53 --> 07:55] where the rest of the Romans actually were,
[07:55 --> 07:58] Perseus broke north out of his fortified position and
[07:58 --> 08:01] set himself up near the village of Pydna, where the
[08:01 --> 08:04] open, flat country would ensure the proper deployment
[08:04 --> 08:05] of his phalanx.
[08:07 --> 08:09] Having flushed out his prey, Paulus immediately
[08:09 --> 08:12] recombined his force and marched to meet Perseus.
[08:13 --> 08:15] After spending the night camped across the plain
[08:15 --> 08:18] from each other, the two sides rose the next morning
[08:18 --> 08:19] eager to have it out.
[08:20 --> 08:24] According to legend, Paulus, facing east, stalled
[08:24 --> 08:26] his deployment until the afternoon when the sun
[08:26 --> 08:28] would be in the eyes of the Macedonians.
[08:29 --> 08:31] Whether this is true or not is a matter of debate,
[08:32 --> 08:34] but it is true that the battle did not start until
[08:34 --> 08:37] the afternoon, and despite the evenly matched
[08:37 --> 08:39] sizes of the two armies, things quickly got away
[08:39 --> 08:40] from Perseus.
[08:41 --> 08:43] Whether or not the sun played any role is,
[08:43 --> 08:44] again, a matter of debate.
[08:46 --> 08:48] The Greek phalanx pushed the Romans back
[08:48 --> 08:51] initially, which was good, but they pushed the
[08:51 --> 08:53] Romans back onto uneven hills bordering the
[08:53 --> 08:55] plain, which was bad.
[08:55 --> 08:58] The phalanx began to splinter, and the Romans
[08:58 --> 09:00] were able to send individual maniples through
[09:00 --> 09:03] the breaks in the Macedonian line and not so
[09:03 --> 09:05] much flank the Macedonians as eat them
[09:05 --> 09:06] from the inside out.
[09:07 --> 09:09] The Macedonian left disintegrated, and
[09:09 --> 09:10] Perseus fled with his cavalry.
[09:11 --> 09:14] Of the 40,000 or so Greeks in the Macedonian
[09:14 --> 09:17] army, at least 25,000 died at Pydna, while
[09:17 --> 09:20] the Romans lost maybe 1,000.
[09:20 --> 09:23] 5,000 Greeks were captured along with Perseus himself.
[09:24 --> 09:26] Where his father had managed to negotiate a
[09:26 --> 09:28] peace that left him in control of Macedon,
[09:29 --> 09:30] Perseus received no such favors.
[09:31 --> 09:33] The young king was paraded through Roman chains
[09:33 --> 09:36] at Paulus' triumph, and then banished to exile
[09:36 --> 09:39] in a small Italian village where he lived a
[09:39 --> 09:41] miserable existence and died in obscurity,
[09:41 --> 09:43] and he showed such promise.
[09:45 --> 09:47] The defeat at Pydna marked the end of the
[09:47 --> 09:49] Macedonian kingdom, whose holdings under
[09:49 --> 09:52] Alexander had once extended all the way to India.
[09:53 --> 09:55] The Senate broke the kingdom up into four
[09:55 --> 09:57] republics, which were forbidden to trade
[09:57 --> 09:59] directly with one another or any other Greek city.
[10:00 --> 10:03] All economic activity had to be brokered by Rome.
[10:04 --> 10:06] This ensured that no undue consolidation of
[10:06 --> 10:08] riches or power occurred, and that the
[10:08 --> 10:10] Romans would never have to deal with
[10:10 --> 10:11] trouble in Macedon again.
[10:12 --> 10:15] Weak and divided, the Macedonians would
[10:15 --> 10:16] attempt one last-ditch effort for
[10:16 --> 10:19] independence years later, but that would
[10:19 --> 10:21] merely present the Romans with an opportunity
[10:21 --> 10:24] to officially incorporate the territory
[10:24 --> 10:26] into the province of Macedonia.
[10:28 --> 10:31] Returning to Rome, Paulus, who had done so
[10:31 --> 10:33] much to end the senseless pillaging of the
[10:33 --> 10:36] legions, led his army on one of the great
[10:36 --> 10:38] sadistic rampages of the ancient world.
[10:39 --> 10:41] Passing through Opirus, the Romans,
[10:41 --> 10:43] furious at the Greeks in general for
[10:43 --> 10:46] turning on Rome, decided that an example had
[10:46 --> 10:48] to be made of someone to prevent this sort
[10:48 --> 10:50] of thing from happening in the future.
[10:51 --> 10:53] They chose Opirus because it was convenient,
[10:53 --> 10:55] even though the locals had nothing to do
[10:55 --> 10:57] really with Perseus or his war against the Romans.
[10:59 --> 11:01] At first, Paulus implied that if he was
[11:01 --> 11:04] paid off, Opirus would be spared, and
[11:04 --> 11:06] the 70 or so towns collected as much as
[11:06 --> 11:08] they could and handed it willingly to the Romans.
[11:09 --> 11:11] But the minute Paulus had collected it all,
[11:12 --> 11:14] he simply let his men off their leashes and
[11:14 --> 11:17] let them sack, rape, plunder, and burn anyone
[11:17 --> 11:18] and anything they came across.
[11:19 --> 11:22] Over 150,000 locals were bound up and
[11:22 --> 11:23] sold into slavery.
[11:24 --> 11:27] The rest were killed and left destitute or homeless.
[11:28 --> 11:30] It was a harsh lesson for the Greeks,
[11:30 --> 11:33] harsher still for the relative innocence of Opirus.
[11:34 --> 11:36] After driving off Philip and proclaiming
[11:36 --> 11:39] freedom for Greece, the Romans were universally loved.
[11:40 --> 11:42] But now, a mere 30 years later,
[11:42 --> 11:45] that love was gone, replaced with fear.
[11:46 --> 11:47] Machiavelli's point that it is better
[11:47 --> 11:49] to be feared than loved is backed up
[11:49 --> 11:51] by the Roman experience in Greece.
[11:52 --> 11:54] Loved, the Romans dealt constantly with
[11:54 --> 11:57] backstabbing and conspiracies to do away with them.
[11:57 --> 12:01] Feared, the Romans ruled in peace and unchallenged.
[12:02 --> 12:03] There is no accounting for the horror
[12:03 --> 12:05] and immorality on display in Opirus,
[12:05 --> 12:09] but the cold fact remains that it worked.
[12:09 --> 12:11] Future Greeks knew what the wrath of Rome meant
[12:11 --> 12:14] and they wanted no part of it.
[12:14 --> 12:16] Better to drink wine and tutor the Romans
[12:16 --> 12:18] in math and philosophy than attempt
[12:18 --> 12:19] to cross swords with them.
[12:22 --> 12:23] One of the other legacies left to us
[12:23 --> 12:26] by the Roman victory in the Third Macedonian War
[12:26 --> 12:28] was the transportation of a great number
[12:28 --> 12:30] of Greek hostages to Rome,
[12:30 --> 12:32] including a young scholar named Polybius.
[12:33 --> 12:36] Taken in by the family of Aemilius Paulus,
[12:36 --> 12:37] Polybius would become the instructor
[12:37 --> 12:40] of Paulus' son, Scipio Aemilianus,
[12:41 --> 12:43] who would grow up to be one of the most famous
[12:43 --> 12:45] and influential of all Roman statesmen
[12:45 --> 12:48] and really the last of the great political figures
[12:48 --> 12:49] who was not connected to the crises
[12:49 --> 12:52] that would consume the Republic in the next century.
[12:53 --> 12:55] In an attempt to explain to his fellow Greeks
[12:55 --> 12:58] who the Romans were and where they came from,
[12:58 --> 13:01] Polybius constructed a massive history of Rome,
[13:01 --> 13:03] which exists largely intact today
[13:03 --> 13:05] and stands as one of the pillars
[13:05 --> 13:06] of our own understanding of Rome.
[13:08 --> 13:10] The histories of Polybius have, indeed,
[13:10 --> 13:12] played an integral part in our very own
[13:12 --> 13:14] History of Rome podcast and we owe him
[13:14 --> 13:16] a great debt for his excellent work.
[13:18 --> 13:20] Next week, we will return for the last time
[13:20 --> 13:22] to Carthage and Macedon.
[13:23 --> 13:25] The two great enemies who had so consumed
[13:25 --> 13:27] the Romans for the last century were beaten,
[13:27 --> 13:29] but for Rome, it would not be enough
[13:29 --> 13:31] to simply beat them.
[13:31 --> 13:32] They had to be crushed.
[13:34 --> 13:35] Cato the Elder had made a point of ending
[13:35 --> 13:37] every speech before the Senate,
[13:37 --> 13:39] whatever the topic, be it garbage collection
[13:39 --> 13:42] or loan repayment, with the line,
[13:42 --> 13:44] furthermore, it is my opinion
[13:44 --> 13:45] that Carthage must be destroyed.
[13:47 --> 13:49] Cato, like many of his countrymen,
[13:49 --> 13:51] feared the return of Carthage
[13:51 --> 13:53] and so set out to annihilate once and for all
[13:53 --> 13:56] their nemesis from Africa and quite literally,
[13:56 --> 13:58] sow their fields with salt.

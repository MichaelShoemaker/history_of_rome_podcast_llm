[00:57 --> 01:09] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 81, The Greekling.
[01:09 --> 01:13] The Roman Empire had just enjoyed 20 years of wise and beneficial stewardship when the
[01:13 --> 01:18] tragic but inevitable news arrived that the Emperor Trajan was dead.
[01:18 --> 01:23] Even his contemporaries realized that they were living under the best Emperor since Augustus,
[01:23 --> 01:27] and fears about what came next filtered through every level of society.
[01:27 --> 01:32] With Trajan being so great and all, it's pretty reasonable to assume that whoever succeeds
[01:32 --> 01:34] him is going to be worse.
[01:34 --> 01:37] Maybe not much worse, but it's going to be a step backwards.
[01:37 --> 01:39] You can't get better than Optimus.
[01:39 --> 01:42] It's a logical impossibility.
[01:42 --> 01:45] And who knows, maybe his successor will be a lot worse.
[01:45 --> 01:47] It's happened before.
[01:48 --> 01:50] One of the things that struck everyone's fears was the fact that Trajan had paid almost
[01:50 --> 01:55] no attention to the issue of succession publicly, which also meant that, hooray, another round
[01:55 --> 02:00] of civil wars just might be how we determine who the eventual ruler, who will inevitably
[02:00 --> 02:02] be worse than Trajan, will be.
[02:02 --> 02:04] Sweet.
[02:04 --> 02:09] The anxiety that surrounded Trajan's day-to-day health was palpable, and when he began to
[02:09 --> 02:15] seriously deteriorate in 117, his closest advisors began to take seriously the consequences
[02:15 --> 02:16] of his death.
[02:16 --> 02:21] Would it be possible to find a name and heir who would be acceptable to all the various
[02:21 --> 02:26] aristocratic factions and who wouldn't bollocks up the whole thing once he got into power?
[02:26 --> 02:30] Obviously, no one we find is going to be as good as Trajan, so who can we dig up who will
[02:30 --> 02:33] be the least bad choice?
[02:33 --> 02:38] Names were bandied about, but Trajan's influential wife, Pompeia Plotina, worked behind the scenes
[02:38 --> 02:42] to ensure that everyone understood that the only man who could reasonably succeed the
[02:42 --> 02:48] dead emperor was her former ward, Publius Aelius Hadrianus.
[02:48 --> 02:52] Trajan himself seems to have been wishy-washy about Hadrian and had been unwilling to commit
[02:52 --> 02:58] himself to the young man, even though he was Trajan's only living male relative.
[02:58 --> 03:03] Hadrian had enjoyed a good career and had many doors open for him by virtue of his relation
[03:03 --> 03:09] to Trajan, but he had never received the special exceptions that signaled eventual inheritance.
[03:09 --> 03:14] While Trajan may not have been fully sold on his cocky, promiscuous, philhellene nephew,
[03:14 --> 03:19] his wife certainly was, and when the emperor died without leaving clear succession instructions,
[03:19 --> 03:24] his opinion, to put it bluntly, no longer mattered.
[03:24 --> 03:28] The official rumor is that when Trajan died, Pompeia quickly hushed up the death and may
[03:28 --> 03:33] have gone so far as to hire an actor to lay in the vacated deathbed pretending to be the
[03:33 --> 03:38] emperor for the purposes of issuing the final recommendation that Hadrian ought to succeed
[03:38 --> 03:39] him.
[03:39 --> 03:44] While the veracity of this story is hard to pin down, the letters arriving in the senate
[03:44 --> 03:49] announcing the last wishes of Trajan and the adoption of Hadrian were all signed by Pompeia,
[03:49 --> 03:54] a singular occurrence in the whole of Trajan's reign, leading most to suspect that the empress
[03:54 --> 03:56] authored the orders herself.
[03:56 --> 04:02] Pompeia, though, was not acting out of the pure self-interest that had driven, say, Agrippina.
[04:02 --> 04:06] Sure, she knew that her own position would be secure if Hadrian became emperor, but more
[04:06 --> 04:11] important than that was assuring that the transfer of power was seamless and left no
[04:11 --> 04:13] openings for civil war.
[04:13 --> 04:18] Her husband may have been fantasizing about following Alexander the Great one last time
[04:18 --> 04:23] and leaving the empire to the strongest, but Pompeia was not about to let the Roman world
[04:23 --> 04:27] be sucked back into the abyss of self-destruction.
[04:27 --> 04:32] News of the emperor's death was kept tightly under wraps until Hadrian's position was secured,
[04:32 --> 04:36] and when word finally did make it back to the capital, it arrived at the same time as
[04:36 --> 04:41] news that the legions in the east had gone ahead and declared Hadrian emperor.
[04:41 --> 04:45] The senate and any possible pretenders to the throne were thus forced to deal not with
[04:45 --> 04:49] a power vacuum, but a fait accompli.
[04:49 --> 04:50] Hadrian is already the new emperor.
[04:50 --> 04:53] Deal with it.
[04:53 --> 04:58] Even without his future success coloring our view of his being named heir, Hadrian was
[04:58 --> 05:01] as good a candidate for power as anyone else out there.
[05:01 --> 05:05] He was forty-one years old, well beyond the reach of the youthful excesses that had ruined
[05:05 --> 05:11] Caligula and Nero, had ample military experience at the highest level, had governed provinces,
[05:11 --> 05:16] and was, of course, the sole living male relative of the deceased emperor.
[05:16 --> 05:20] He was not by any means the only man who eyed the death of Trajan with ambition, but there
[05:20 --> 05:24] was never any doubt after Trajan's initial ascension that his younger cousin and former
[05:24 --> 05:28] ward would be on the short list of candidates to succeed him.
[05:28 --> 05:33] In other words, when the Roman world found out that Trajan was dead and Hadrian had succeeded
[05:33 --> 05:39] There was a feeling that, well, yeah, that makes sense.
[05:39 --> 05:46] Publius Aelius Hadrianus was born on January 24, 76 AD, into a Spanish-Italian family of
[05:46 --> 05:48] senatorial rank.
[05:48 --> 05:52] There is some disagreement about whether he was born in his hometown of Italica, near
[05:52 --> 05:56] modern-day Seville, or whether he was actually born in Rome while his parents were in the
[05:56 --> 06:01] capital on business, but the latter smells a lot like post-imperial revisionism, so I
[06:01 --> 06:06] tend to go with the former, even if there is no real proof of it one way or the other.
[06:06 --> 06:11] Italica was a Roman city in Spain that had been founded by Scipio Africanus to house
[06:11 --> 06:15] his injured veterans after he had completed his clean sweep of the Iberian peninsula and
[06:15 --> 06:19] needed to get going on his invasion of North Africa.
[06:19 --> 06:24] Hadrian's family, like Trajan's, had migrated from Italy not long after the colony's foundation
[06:24 --> 06:30] and both quickly became members of a new Spanish-Italian aristocracy, an aristocracy fueled by the
[06:30 --> 06:34] lucrative Spanish olive-oil trade.
[06:34 --> 06:38] Hadrian's father was a well-regarded senator, like his neighbor and cousin Marcus Opius
[06:38 --> 06:42] Trajanus, the future emperor Trajan.
[06:42 --> 06:46] The elder Hadrian served with distinction across the empire, eventually rising to the
[06:46 --> 06:53] rank of praetor, before he died unexpectedly in 86 AD while still in his mid-forties.
[06:53 --> 06:57] Hadrian was only ten at the time, and as the only male in line, he was thrust into the
[06:57 --> 07:01] role of paterfamilias at an incredibly young age.
[07:01 --> 07:05] But since he was still a minor and everyone fretted about boys who grow up without strong
[07:05 --> 07:10] male guidance, Hadrian's education was entrusted to his cousin Trajan, who was fast rising
[07:10 --> 07:15] in Roman politics, and another Spanish-Italian noble named Publius Aetianus, who will play
[07:15 --> 07:21] a key, if infamous, role in Hadrian's early administration.
[07:21 --> 07:25] Young Hadrian was educated in classic Roman fashion and the zeal the boys showed for all
[07:25 --> 07:31] things Greek, literature, philosophy, art, whatever, earned him the nickname Graccholus,
[07:31 --> 07:34] which meant little Greek or Greekling.
[07:34 --> 07:39] It was a mildly disparaging nickname, as the typical Roman aristocrat studied Greek culture
[07:39 --> 07:45] yes, but kept the sensuous and corrupting passions of the East at arm's length.
[07:45 --> 07:49] Hadrian, though, embraced all things Greek, and for the rest of his life idolized and
[07:49 --> 07:54] sought to emulate his heroes Homer and Xenophon and Plato.
[07:54 --> 07:59] The villa complex he would build for himself after becoming emperor was nothing less than
[07:59 --> 08:07] a massive homage to the Greeks in its architecture, landscaping, and underlying philosophic principles.
[08:07 --> 08:12] When Hadrian was fourteen, Trajan brought him to Rome to personally supervise the last
[08:12 --> 08:17] stages of the boys' education and oversee his transition to manhood.
[08:17 --> 08:21] Trajan was just completing the consulship he had been awarded by demission for his rapid
[08:21 --> 08:26] response to Saturninus' revolt, and the teenage Hadrian found himself planted right smack
[08:26 --> 08:30] dab in the middle of Roman power politics.
[08:30 --> 08:34] At this point, there would have been little reason for Hadrian to dream that he might
[08:34 --> 08:39] himself don the purple one day, but his close relationship to Trajan meant that he was definitely
[08:39 --> 08:44] being prepared for an important role in the imperial system somewhere, so he best pay
[08:44 --> 08:46] attention.
[08:46 --> 08:50] Living in Rome during the last years of demission's reign, not that anyone knew that they were
[08:50 --> 08:54] the last years of demission's reign, gave Hadrian a close-up view of what to do and
[08:54 --> 09:00] what not to do with power, and his later conduct hints that he learned his lessons well, even
[09:00 --> 09:05] if there were a few growing pains at first.
[09:05 --> 09:10] Through the influence of Trajan, Hadrian received three consecutive military tribunships in
[09:10 --> 09:14] Pannonia, Moesia, and Upper Germany successively.
[09:14 --> 09:19] It was unusual for a young aristocrat to serve even two consecutive tours, as most simply
[09:19 --> 09:23] did their year's service and went back to the comfort of their estates.
[09:23 --> 09:27] But Trajan was obviously intent on instilling Hadrian with all the martial virtues that
[09:27 --> 09:30] he himself so prized.
[09:30 --> 09:34] For his part, Hadrian seems to have been an excellent and well-liked soldier.
[09:34 --> 09:36] He enjoyed camp life.
[09:36 --> 09:41] The camaraderie, the attention to detail, the rigorous exercise all appealed to him,
[09:41 --> 09:45] and for the rest of his life, he was able to come and go from legionary camps with ease,
[09:45 --> 09:50] speaking the language of his soldiers and willingly sharing in their hardships.
[09:50 --> 09:55] Though he is remembered today as the quintessential pacifist emperor, Hadrian always loved military
[09:55 --> 10:01] life, and his troops, in turn, always loved him.
[10:01 --> 10:05] It was while he was serving his second tribunship in Moesia that Hadrian learned that his elder
[10:05 --> 10:10] cousin had been adopted by Nerva, and it was while he was serving on his third tour in
[10:10 --> 10:14] Upper Germany a few months later that he learned that the old emperor was dead and Trajan now
[10:14 --> 10:17] ruled in his own right.
[10:17 --> 10:21] Tradition has it, as I mentioned, that it was Hadrian himself who rode to Trajan's command
[10:21 --> 10:26] post on the lower Rhine and delivered news of Nerva's death.
[10:26 --> 10:30] Just like that, in the span of about four months, Hadrian went from a young provincial
[10:30 --> 10:35] noble looking to get started on a career to the sole living male relative of the emperor
[10:35 --> 10:37] of the Roman Empire.
[10:37 --> 10:41] Needless to say, whatever ambitions he had had for himself were about to be ratcheted
[10:41 --> 10:45] up about a thousand percent.
[10:45 --> 10:51] But if Hadrian expected to be treated like Gaius and Lucius, or more recently Titus Flavius,
[10:51 --> 10:54] he was sadly mistaken.
[10:54 --> 10:57] Trajan showed absolutely no sign that he planned to share any of his imperial power with his
[10:57 --> 11:00] young cousin.
[11:00 --> 11:04] Hadrian's career would obviously receive a healthy leg up, but so did a lot of other
[11:04 --> 11:06] people's careers.
[11:06 --> 11:10] Everyone connected to Spanish Rome benefited from having one of their own on the throne,
[11:10 --> 11:14] but there is no indication that Trajan was any more or less disposed towards his former
[11:14 --> 11:16] war than anyone else.
[11:16 --> 11:21] Indeed, if we dig a little, we find that it's possible Trajan was skeptical that the brash
[11:21 --> 11:26] bordering on flamboyant Greekling was fit for high office of any kind, and that it was
[11:26 --> 11:33] the constant lobbying of Pompey who kept the future emperor's career moving steadily upward.
[11:33 --> 11:37] Perhaps at Pompey's urging, Hadrian was assigned to act as the new emperor's official emissary
[11:38 --> 11:41] soon after Trajan's ascension.
[11:41 --> 11:45] He was tasked with reading aloud the emperor's letters home, a job that apparently caused
[11:45 --> 11:51] Hadrian some embarrassment as his rough accent, a mix of Spanish and military pronunciations,
[11:51 --> 11:55] was ridiculed by the cultured Italian elite.
[11:55 --> 12:00] But if he was bummed about not immediately being named Caesar and instead being turned
[12:00 --> 12:04] into a glorified secretary, Hadrian could not help but believe he was still going to
[12:04 --> 12:10] succeed Trajan one day, as the emperor arranged for the daughter of his favorite niece, Vibhya
[12:10 --> 12:17] Sabina, to marry him in 100 AD, further strengthening the familial ties between the two men.
[12:17 --> 12:21] The marriage would prove to be politically useful, but personally unhappy, as neither
[12:21 --> 12:24] seems to have liked the other very much.
[12:24 --> 12:28] For one thing, Hadrian appears to have had far more affection for his mother-in-law than
[12:28 --> 12:33] his wife, which forever rankled young Sabina, and of course, it did not help any that Hadrian
[12:33 --> 12:37] was gay, a fact we'll explore in more detail next week.
[12:37 --> 12:42] Obviously, the marriage produced no children.
[12:42 --> 12:46] Hadrian's career continued its vague course upwards, and we know that he accompanied Trajan
[12:46 --> 12:51] on both legs of the Dacian Wars, but we have no record of what, if anything, the young
[12:51 --> 12:55] officer accomplished in his first tours of real combat duty.
[12:55 --> 13:00] He was awarded a praetorship in 106 AD, after the final victory over Decebalus, and was
[13:00 --> 13:04] given command of a legion in Germany that same year.
[13:04 --> 13:09] The next year, he was assigned a pro praetorship in Pannonia, and once again commanded a legion,
[13:09 --> 13:14] but in both cases, he was still subordinate to the sitting provincial governor.
[13:14 --> 13:19] In 108, he was granted a consulship, but it was a less prestigious Suffet consulship,
[13:19 --> 13:23] a minor slight that escaped no one's attention.
[13:23 --> 13:26] Trajan was obviously of two minds about Hadrian.
[13:26 --> 13:31] On the one hand, he was moving his cousin up in the world, but on the other, he wasn't
[13:31 --> 13:38] coming close to granting him heir status, presumptive, apparent, or otherwise.
[13:38 --> 13:41] What Hadrian made of all this is anyone's guess.
[13:41 --> 13:45] I would suppose that he was somewhere in between two extremes.
[13:45 --> 13:48] He doesn't seem to have been vocally cranky that he was being denied what he felt was
[13:48 --> 13:53] rightfully his, but neither does he seem to have been relieved that he wasn't going to
[13:53 --> 13:56] wind up on the hot seat himself one day.
[13:56 --> 14:01] He was ambitious, and he was capable, and likely coveted the imperial throne, but he
[14:01 --> 14:06] wasn't marching around with an immature sense of entitlement either.
[14:06 --> 14:10] He sort of disappears from the public record for a few years following his consulship,
[14:10 --> 14:15] eventually turning up in Athens in 112, where he was an eager tourist and student.
[14:15 --> 14:19] He immersed himself in the cultural life of the city enough that he was given Athenian
[14:19 --> 14:26] citizenship and elected an archon, one of the senior civic magistrates of the city.
[14:26 --> 14:31] After his tour of Greece, Hadrian followed Trajan east in 114, and, at least for the
[14:31 --> 14:36] early part of the new campaign, once again found himself assigned tasks beneath the purview
[14:36 --> 14:38] of historians.
[14:38 --> 14:43] He was likely attached to Trajan's staff, as Cassius Dio mentions that he shared in
[14:43 --> 14:47] the quote, day-to-day activities of the emperor.
[14:47 --> 14:51] While we don't know exactly what he got up to, we know that he had a front row seat for
[14:51 --> 14:55] the initial conquest and the local revolts that followed.
[14:55 --> 14:59] The speed with which he abandoned Trajan's conquered territories tells us that through
[14:59 --> 15:06] this period, the reliably loyal Hadrian was likely critical of Trajan's policies in private.
[15:06 --> 15:10] But his doubts don't seem to have affected his relationship with the emperor, and in
[15:10 --> 15:16] 117, Hadrian was finally given an independent command, and not just any command, but the
[15:16 --> 15:21] governorship of Syria, one of the most important posts in the empire.
[15:21 --> 15:25] Trajan had recently reassigned the previous governor to Dacia, where a revolt was underway,
[15:25 --> 15:30] and for the first time, he decided to hand his cousin some real power.
[15:30 --> 15:35] Clearly, whatever doubts he had had about the Greekling had been satisfied, as the governorship
[15:35 --> 15:39] of Syria was no token prize.
[15:39 --> 15:42] For Hadrian, the promotion could not have come at a better time.
[15:42 --> 15:47] No one could have known it at the time, but Trajan was entering his final year in office,
[15:47 --> 15:51] and the issue of succession was about to rear its ugly, and thus far still utterly
[15:51 --> 15:53] unaddressed, head.
[15:53 --> 15:58] It was by a lucky stroke of fate, then, that rather than being just another staff officer,
[15:58 --> 16:02] one likely assigned for no other reason than that he was related to the emperor, Hadrian
[16:02 --> 16:07] found himself instead serving as the governor of Syria when Trajan died.
[16:07 --> 16:12] Not only was it a prestigious and strategically critical post, but most importantly, it put
[16:12 --> 16:15] him at the head of his very own army.
[16:15 --> 16:19] It was one thing to buck for power from the shady corners of the imperial entourage, it
[16:19 --> 16:25] was quite another to do so from the head of the eastern legions.
[16:25 --> 16:29] I don't think I need to rehash the circumstances of Trajan's death again, so I'll just leave
[16:29 --> 16:36] it that Hadrian was an Antioch in August of 117 AD, when he heard that Trajan was dead.
[16:36 --> 16:40] Through the string-pulling of Pompeii, Hadrian found out slightly before everyone else, and
[16:40 --> 16:43] he was forced to sit on the news.
[16:43 --> 16:47] He also was forced to sit on the news that it was going to be announced that Trajan had
[16:47 --> 16:52] named him heir, news that cannot have been easy to just sit on.
[16:52 --> 16:56] There were more than a few of Trajan's lieutenants, though, who could easily picture themselves
[16:56 --> 17:02] in the purple, so it was going to be important to play the transfer of power just right.
[17:02 --> 17:07] For the most part, at least in the initial stages, Hadrian hit a pitch-perfect note.
[17:07 --> 17:12] He marched out to the head of his Syrian legions and formally announced the news of Trajan's
[17:12 --> 17:17] death, at which point the troops spontaneously hailed him as emperor, just as they had likely
[17:17 --> 17:19] been instructed to do.
[17:19 --> 17:23] He then drafted a note to the Senate, apologizing for the haste with which his soldiers had
[17:23 --> 17:25] embraced him.
[17:25 --> 17:29] He was sorry events had moved so quickly that the Senate had been cut out of the process.
[17:29 --> 17:35] He promised to continue Nerva and Trajan's policy of leaving senators more or less sacrosanct,
[17:35 --> 17:39] and promised that once he was sure the borders were secure, that he would return to Rome
[17:39 --> 17:44] and consult with the venerable conscript fathers.
[17:44 --> 17:48] Back in Rome, all of this hit the Senate at the same time.
[17:48 --> 17:53] Trajan was dead, he had named Hadrian heir, the eastern legions had gone ahead and hailed
[17:53 --> 17:57] Hadrian as emperor, and he had accepted.
[17:57 --> 17:58] What could they do about it?
[17:58 --> 18:03] So they ratified the quote unquote last witches of Trajan and confirmed Hadrian as the new
[18:03 --> 18:08] emperor, keeping on him all the titles and honors of his predecessor.
[18:08 --> 18:12] Hadrian accepted most of the accolades, but pointedly refused the title Father of the
[18:12 --> 18:19] People, an honorific he felt should be earned, not just handed out willy-nilly.
[18:19 --> 18:24] The first thing the new emperor did was travel to Cilicia to oversee the funeral and cremation
[18:24 --> 18:25] of Trajan.
[18:25 --> 18:30] Obviously, he could not have done otherwise, but beyond the purely ceremonial optics, the
[18:30 --> 18:35] trip allowed Hadrian an early opportunity to meet face to face with Trajan's inner
[18:35 --> 18:41] circle and confirm their behind the scenes support for his new administration.
[18:41 --> 18:45] Though Hadrian maintained a confident public front, there was still much to fear in the
[18:45 --> 18:49] political back rooms in the legionary tents of the empire.
[18:49 --> 18:53] He seems to have secured the support of the Trajan loyalists, but there were a handful
[18:53 --> 18:57] of powerful rivals who would need to be dealt with quickly to ensure that his reign was
[18:57 --> 19:01] more Augustus and less Galba.
[19:01 --> 19:06] At first, his narrow purge would only put proverbial heads on the chopping block, but
[19:06 --> 19:13] in a few months real heads would roll, causing Hadrian all manner of political havoc.
[19:13 --> 19:16] Initially though, Hadrian refused to do anything violent.
[19:16 --> 19:21] His old guardian Atianus had risen to the rank of Praetorian Prefect and wrote to Hadrian
[19:21 --> 19:26] soon after the latter's ascension that a few senators were plotting a coup.
[19:26 --> 19:31] The Prefect counseled immediate executions, but Hadrian disagreed.
[19:31 --> 19:35] This was no time to go around lopping off heads, maybe later if there was proof of
[19:35 --> 19:43] their continued sedition, but for now the official policy was wait and see.
[19:43 --> 19:46] But though he was not in the mood to stain his new administration with blood, at least
[19:46 --> 19:51] not yet, Hadrian was well aware of what the score was.
[19:51 --> 19:56] Men who could not be counted on or who were suspected of their own imperial ambitions
[19:57 --> 20:01] from their positions and replaced with men loyal to Hadrian.
[20:01 --> 20:05] One of the first and most famous to go was Lucius Quietus, the North African general
[20:05 --> 20:09] Trajan had left in command of the legions in Mesopotamia.
[20:09 --> 20:14] An aggressive Trajanite, Quietus not only had motivation to unseat the new emperor,
[20:14 --> 20:18] but also the means to do something about it.
[20:18 --> 20:23] What Hadrian needed to deny his rival for power was the opportunity to act.
[20:23 --> 20:29] So he unceremoniously terminated Quietus' command and ordered him to head back west.
[20:29 --> 20:33] This command change was then followed by the famous order that very possibly would have
[20:33 --> 20:38] spurned Quietus into open revolt had he still been in charge, and an order that would set
[20:38 --> 20:41] the tone for Hadrian's entire reign.
[20:41 --> 20:46] Just days after becoming emperor, Hadrian ordered the legions to begin withdrawing from
[20:46 --> 20:51] all the territories in the east Trajan had just conquered.
[20:51 --> 20:55] The order would come as a shock to the political classes, and had he not already established
[20:55 --> 20:59] himself as a favorite son of the legions, it is likely they would have rioted when he
[20:59 --> 21:04] more or less declared they were going to abandon the territory they had all just won with their
[21:04 --> 21:06] blood and sweat.
[21:06 --> 21:11] I say more or less because Hadrian never made any formal announcement of his intentions,
[21:11 --> 21:17] likely recognizing that an openly stated policy of withdrawal would have been political suicide.
[21:17 --> 21:22] Instead, he just began recalling the expeditionary forces back to their former barracks on the
[21:22 --> 21:25] west side of the Euphrates.
[21:25 --> 21:29] It is not a decision Hadrian entered into lightly, and the speed with which he implemented
[21:29 --> 21:34] his new policy and the tenacity with which he stuck to it in the face of domestic political
[21:34 --> 21:39] attacks demonstrates that he had been thinking about it for a very long time.
[21:39 --> 21:44] Indeed, as we will see, the idea of withdrawing behind the traditional defensible Augustan
[21:44 --> 21:49] borders of the Empire was at the very core of Hadrian's being.
[21:49 --> 21:56] The abandonment of Mesopotamia was no tactical retreat, it was a strategic realignment.
[21:56 --> 22:01] That didn't make the bitter pill of reducing the territory of the Empire go down any easier,
[22:01 --> 22:05] but the new emperor was adamant about his vision for the future, and it is a testament
[22:05 --> 22:13] to his political skill that he was able to make such a hugely unpopular decision stick.
[22:13 --> 22:18] Next week, we will see that Hadrian's vision for an eternally defensible empire was not
[22:18 --> 22:20] limited to the Euphrates.
[22:20 --> 22:25] All across the Empire, he would build defensive fortifications to mark the permanent boundary
[22:25 --> 22:28] of the civilized world.
[22:28 --> 22:32] But if in so doing he earned himself a reputation as a pacifist, then we need to rethink the
[22:32 --> 22:34] meaning of that word.
[22:34 --> 22:39] Whatever else it is, building huge stone walls that restrict the movement of previously unmolested
[22:39 --> 22:43] locals is not a passive move.
[22:43 --> 22:48] I think Hadrian is best described as running a highly aggressive defense.
[22:48 --> 22:53] His goal was not to just sit back and man the walls, it was to project Roman power across
[22:53 --> 22:58] the Mediterranean and control not just the civilized interior, but the own ruling tribes
[22:58 --> 23:00] beyond the frontier.
[23:00 --> 23:05] Not with military occupation, but with overwhelming economic and political dominance.

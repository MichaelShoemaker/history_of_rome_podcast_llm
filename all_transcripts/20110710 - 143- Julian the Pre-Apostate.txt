[00:37 --> 00:42] This week, I'm going to go with a recommendation from listener Richard Eppert in honor of the
[00:42 --> 00:48] fact that it was just Independence Day here in the States, 1776 by David McCullough, an
[00:48 --> 00:53] eminently accessible account of the most famous year in American history.

[00:58 --> 01:03] you.
[01:03 --> 01:15] Hello and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 143, Julian the Pre-Apostate.
[01:15 --> 01:20] After defeating Magnentius, dispensing with Gallus, and putting down the recent revolt
[01:20 --> 01:25] of Sylvanus, for the first time in a long time, Constantius II was completely secure
[01:25 --> 01:26] on the throne.
[01:27 --> 01:31] But with everything that had gone on the last few years, it must have felt like the most
[01:31 --> 01:34] insecure security in the world.
[01:34 --> 01:38] Like that at any moment some chunk of the empire could slip away and bring Constantius
[01:38 --> 01:42] crashing down with it.
[01:42 --> 01:46] Opportunistic German tribes had taken advantage of the shaky Rhine defenses, leaving the West
[01:46 --> 01:48] awash in barbarian invaders.
[01:48 --> 01:53] The Sarmatians were a persistent source of trouble along the Danube and it seemed like
[01:53 --> 01:58] the Sassanids would come crashing back into Mesopotamia at any moment.
[01:58 --> 02:02] So while Constantius had to have been happy that he now was the sole and unchallenged
[02:02 --> 02:08] ruler of the empire, he also had to have been more than a little wary about what the future
[02:08 --> 02:10] had in store for him.
[02:10 --> 02:15] With all of this weighing on his mind, the emperor finally decided in November of 355
[02:15 --> 02:19] to elevate the last male member of his family to the purple and hope the young man would
[02:19 --> 02:26] be able to help shore up that insecure security Constantius was wrestling with.
[02:26 --> 02:31] It was obvious that at this stage in history, the empire absolutely needed multiple emperors
[02:31 --> 02:35] fighting on multiple fronts to keep the whole project from falling apart.
[02:35 --> 02:40] And so, enter Julian the Apostate.
[02:40 --> 02:47] Julian had been born in 331 or 332 AD in Constantinople and as we've already seen, he managed to
[02:47 --> 02:52] survive the massacre of the princes by virtue of the fact that he was too young to pose
[02:52 --> 02:54] any immediate threat.
[02:54 --> 02:59] After the massacre, Julian was shipped off with his brother to Bithynium to live with
[02:59 --> 03:04] their maternal grandmother and he appears to have had a happy few years living in comfortable
[03:04 --> 03:06] pseudo-exile.
[03:06 --> 03:11] His education was overseen by the bishop Eusebius, the same bishop Constantius had pushed to
[03:11 --> 03:18] take over Constantinople in 338, and a Gothic eunuch named Mardonius.
[03:18 --> 03:24] After Eusebius died in 341, Julian and Gallus were packed off to an imperial estate in Cappadocia
[03:24 --> 03:29] and there was nothing pseudo about this exile.
[03:29 --> 03:33] Far from the cosmopolitan centers of the empire, the villa in Cappadocia became a prison that
[03:33 --> 03:38] young Julian only managed to escape by means of the collection of books he was allowed
[03:38 --> 03:41] to accumulate.
[03:41 --> 03:45] Finding anything that seemed even mildly interesting, Julian became enamored with Greek
[03:45 --> 03:51] philosophy and the pagan cults of old, though he was always careful to focus first and foremost
[03:51 --> 03:59] on Christian texts to avoid any unpleasant questions about where his heart might be drifting.
[03:59 --> 04:04] In 348, probably because he already had his eye on them as potential heirs, the sonless
[04:04 --> 04:09] Constantius recalled his cousins from their Cappadocian exile.
[04:09 --> 04:13] Eusebius likely spent some time in Ephesus before settling in at Constantinople while
[04:13 --> 04:18] Julian spent the next two years bouncing between the capital and Nicomedia, furthering both
[04:18 --> 04:25] his classical and Christian education by studying with the greatest teachers of his age.
[04:25 --> 04:30] Following the revolt of Magnentius, the universe fired a warning shot across Julian's contemplative
[04:30 --> 04:35] bow when he found himself present in Sirmium to witness his brother's elevation to the
[04:35 --> 04:38] rank of Caesar.
[04:38 --> 04:42] It is one thing to be the kept relative of a distant Augustus.
[04:42 --> 04:45] It is quite another to be the brother of a Caesar.
[04:45 --> 04:50] The political waters were lapping at Julian's heels.
[04:50 --> 04:54] But they would not drown him just yet, and for the next few years he was allowed some
[04:54 --> 04:59] freedom of movement to continue his studies, so he traveled up and down the Anatolian coast
[04:59 --> 05:06] where he sought out the great masters of philosophy and rhetoric and even magic.
[05:06 --> 05:12] It was at this point, around about 351 or 352 AD, that Julian turned decisively away
[05:12 --> 05:14] from Christianity.
[05:14 --> 05:20] Now, there was no real dramatic moment of conversion where Julian lights a bundle of
[05:20 --> 05:25] scripture on fire and declares himself the enemy of Christianity for all time.
[05:25 --> 05:30] It was just that during this period, the scales of belief tipped away from Christianity and
[05:30 --> 05:33] towards paganism.
[05:33 --> 05:37] Julian knew Christian scripture backward and forward, and had always been troubled by its
[05:37 --> 05:42] many contradictions, and so now he embraced an alternative theology.
[05:42 --> 05:47] The classical philosophy he read and the pagan cults he encountered were exciting, and most
[05:47 --> 05:53] likely they simply offered Julian a more satisfying explanation of the cosmos than he found in
[05:53 --> 05:55] Christian teachings.
[05:55 --> 06:00] I should note, though, that a few armchair psychologists have argued that Julian's rejection
[06:00 --> 06:05] of Christianity may have stemmed from the fact that his devoutly Christian cousin,
[06:05 --> 06:09] Constantius, had, you know, murdered his entire family.
[06:09 --> 06:11] But I think that's unnecessary.
[06:11 --> 06:16] I just think Julian was a whip-smart 20-year-old who turned his back on the traditional religion
[06:16 --> 06:21] of his family in order to pursue more exotic belief systems.
[06:21 --> 06:25] Things like this happen literally every single day, so I don't think we need to bring the
[06:25 --> 06:30] trauma of his childhood in to explain why Julian ultimately turned his back on Christianity
[06:30 --> 06:33] forever.
[06:33 --> 06:38] I have to imagine that the years in between Gallus' rise and Gallus' fall had to have
[06:38 --> 06:40] been the happiest of Julian's life.
[06:40 --> 06:45] He was young, mostly free to come and go as he pleased, and he was surrounded by exciting
[06:45 --> 06:47] new ideas.
[06:47 --> 06:52] For a reserved intellectual like Julian, this had to have been something close to heaven,
[06:52 --> 06:59] enjoying the perks of his imperial connections without any of the political or military entanglements.
[06:59 --> 07:05] However, when the Gallus affair climaxed with the execution of his brother, the idyllic
[07:05 --> 07:10] life of Julian ended, and something far more complicated took its place.
[07:10 --> 07:15] As the last remaining male relative of Constantius, he was called to Milan shortly after his brother's
[07:15 --> 07:21] death in late 354 so that the emperor could size him up, figure out if he was dangerous
[07:21 --> 07:25] first of all, and then figure out if maybe Julian could handle the job of Caesar should
[07:25 --> 07:29] the need arise.
[07:29 --> 07:34] After his arrival in the Italian capital though, he was kept under a sort of house arrest.
[07:34 --> 07:39] He wasn't allowed to leave, but neither was he ever summoned to meet with Constantius.
[07:39 --> 07:43] So is he going to kill me like the rest of my family, is he going to let me go, like
[07:43 --> 07:46] what's the deal here?
[07:46 --> 07:51] This limbo persisted a good seven months, and it was not until mid-355 that Constantius
[07:51 --> 07:55] finally decided to have a look at the boy.
[07:55 --> 08:00] Julian had done his best to adopt a non-threatening posture throughout his life, and after meeting
[08:00 --> 08:05] with the emperor, Julian was relieved to discover that this posture had shown through.
[08:05 --> 08:11] His confinement in Milan did not in fact turn out to be him just sitting on death row.
[08:11 --> 08:17] Constantius decided to let his cousin leave Italy to continue his education.
[08:17 --> 08:21] His life having just flashed before his eyes though, Julian took this opportunity to visit
[08:21 --> 08:29] the only city a burgeoning young intellectual absolutely must visit before they die, Athens.
[08:29 --> 08:34] He received permission to travel to the ancient city and departed at once.
[08:34 --> 08:38] Eager to take in everything that Athens had to offer, he studied at the feet of the Greek
[08:38 --> 08:43] masters and was inducted into the Eleusinian mysteries.
[08:43 --> 08:48] But at the end of autumn 355, just three months after arriving, Julian learned that his days
[08:48 --> 08:51] as a professional student were about to come to an end.
[08:51 --> 08:55] Or maybe, Constantius had reconsidered, and it was his life that was about to come to
[08:55 --> 08:57] an end.
[08:57 --> 09:05] Julian, reluctantly, and most likely fearfully, returned to Milan.
[09:05 --> 09:08] As I'm sure you can probably guess though, Constantius had not called Julian back to
[09:08 --> 09:10] Milan to kill him.
[09:10 --> 09:15] No, he had a far worse fate in store for the cerebral 23 year old.
[09:15 --> 09:20] On November 6, 355 AD, Constantius assembled the troops and announced that he was making
[09:20 --> 09:22] Julian his Caesar.
[09:22 --> 09:29] The troops cheered, Julian cringed, and the empire had itself a new junior emperor.
[09:29 --> 09:32] And what would the new junior emperor's assignment be?
[09:32 --> 09:37] How about ridding all Gaul of its German invaders and returning peace and security to the western
[09:37 --> 09:38] provinces?
[09:38 --> 09:41] Think you can handle that?
[09:41 --> 09:46] This throw him in the deep end and see if he can swim mentality has been taken by some
[09:46 --> 09:50] to indicate that Constantius didn't really care if Julian sank or swam.
[09:50 --> 09:55] If the kid pulls it off then great, the empire is that much better for it.
[09:55 --> 09:58] But if it turns out he's in over his head and gets killed in the fighting, well, that
[09:58 --> 10:03] takes care of a dynastic threat I'll probably just get all paranoid about in a few years
[10:03 --> 10:04] anyway.
[10:04 --> 10:11] In other words, sending Julian north was win-win, at least from Constantius's point of view.
[10:11 --> 10:16] As Julian left for Gaul, I can very much picture the bookmakers of the empire taking odds as
[10:16 --> 10:20] to whether the young Caesar was going to come back alive.
[10:20 --> 10:23] He had no military experience and no political experience.
[10:23 --> 10:28] So if the Germans didn't stab him in the front, then surely some cutthroat advisor
[10:28 --> 10:31] is going to stab him in the back.
[10:31 --> 10:34] Just look at what had happened to his brother.
[10:34 --> 10:38] When the new Caesar arrived in Gaul in his ill-fitting military attire and accompanied
[10:38 --> 10:44] by an entourage whose loyalty first and foremost was to Constantius, no one figured that he
[10:44 --> 10:47] stood a chance.
[10:47 --> 10:51] But to everyone's surprise, Julian decided not to mess around with this thing.
[10:51 --> 10:57] If he was going to be Caesar, then doggone it, he was going to be Caesar.
[10:57 --> 11:01] Much as I'm sure part of him wanted to sit in his tent reading books while other men
[11:01 --> 11:07] took care of his business for him, Julian refused to fall into that trap.
[11:07 --> 11:11] The parallels to Marcus Aurelius on this point are interesting and I often think that in
[11:11 --> 11:16] Julian we get a chance to see what a twenty-something year old Marcus would have been like as an
[11:16 --> 11:23] emperor had not Antoninus Pius inexplicably reigned for like 150 years.
[11:23 --> 11:29] Both men were much more inclined temperamentally to intellectual pursuits, but forced into
[11:29 --> 11:34] action both refused to shirk their duty and they took seriously their role as a military
[11:34 --> 11:35] leader.
[11:35 --> 11:39] It speaks well of both of them.
[11:39 --> 11:45] Over that winter of 355-356 Julian threw himself into the soldier's life, commandeering a drill
[11:45 --> 11:52] sergeant and forcing himself to do everything a new recruit would be expected to do.
[11:52 --> 11:56] The senior officials surrounding the young leader, military and political alike, were
[11:56 --> 12:02] surprised at his dedication, but still they probably were snickering behind his back.
[12:02 --> 12:07] This pampered prince was no soldier, who did he think he was kidding?
[12:07 --> 12:13] At the end of this no doubt stirring montage though Julian was in shape and ready for action.
[12:13 --> 12:17] He had no intention of sitting on the sidelines or being a mere figurehead.
[12:17 --> 12:20] He was going to lead the legions into battle.
[12:20 --> 12:26] If people didn't think he was up to it, well he was just going to have to prove them wrong.
[12:26 --> 12:32] The only question left was where to start.
[12:32 --> 12:36] As I touched on last week, the revolt and subsequent defeat of Magnentius had left the
[12:36 --> 12:39] Rhine defenses in shambles.
[12:39 --> 12:44] Cities were under garrisoned, watchtowers were left unmanned, and the general focus
[12:44 --> 12:48] of everyone had been on the internal threat of Constantius rather than the external threat
[12:48 --> 12:52] of the Alamani and the Franks.
[12:52 --> 12:56] The Germans picked up on this pretty quickly, and in the five years since Magnentius had
[12:56 --> 13:02] donned his purple cloak, the Romans had been pushed back off the Rhine river, losing control
[13:02 --> 13:06] of a good number of cities in the process, including Cologne, the capital of Germania
[13:06 --> 13:09] inferior.
[13:09 --> 13:14] So Julian's first task was clear, march to the lower Rhine and retake the lost urban
[13:14 --> 13:17] centers along the river.
[13:17 --> 13:21] For all of 356, Julian campaigned against the Germans and emerged victorious from a
[13:21 --> 13:24] series of decently sized encounters.
[13:24 --> 13:29] As winter approached, Julian had succeeded in driving off the occupying Germans and retaking,
[13:29 --> 13:33] among other cities, the great military capital of Cologne.
[13:33 --> 13:39] It was a fantastic start to his career, though I would be negligent in my duties if I didn't
[13:39 --> 13:44] point out that defending walled cities was not exactly the Germans' forte.
[13:44 --> 13:49] They withdrew at the first sign of serious pushback from the Romans, but still a good
[13:49 --> 13:53] first day for the new Caesar.
[13:53 --> 13:58] The winter would bring Julian's first taste of real hardship.
[13:58 --> 14:02] After scattering his men across Gaul in winter quarters, Julian himself set up shop with
[14:02 --> 14:05] a small garrison in the city of Sinan.
[14:05 --> 14:10] Julian, confident that the year's campaign had put the Germans on notice, was expecting
[14:10 --> 14:15] no trouble, but as soon as he was settled, an army of Franks suddenly appeared at the
[14:15 --> 14:17] gates of the city.
[14:17 --> 14:21] It was not a large army, but it was bigger than any force Julian could muster right at
[14:21 --> 14:26] that moment, so direct counterattack was out of the question.
[14:26 --> 14:32] That said, the city's defensive fortifications were sturdy, so it looks like if the Germans
[14:32 --> 14:36] want a siege, then a siege is what they are going to get.
[14:36 --> 14:41] The Germans apparently had no problem with this, and so a siege is what they got.
[14:41 --> 14:47] For the next month, Julian was trapped inside the city, unable to break out, but also unwilling
[14:47 --> 14:49] to give up.
[14:49 --> 14:54] Now, the siege of Sinan raises a huge question.
[14:54 --> 14:59] What in the world was Marcellus doing during all of this?
[14:59 --> 15:01] Who was Marcellus, you ask?
[15:01 --> 15:07] Well, he was Julian's master of the horse, who was stationed just a hundred miles away,
[15:07 --> 15:12] with an army big enough to easily drive off the besieging Germans.
[15:12 --> 15:16] He knew what was happening, and yet he did nothing.
[15:16 --> 15:21] He had his excuses, but really, dude, what is so important that you can't pop down and
[15:21 --> 15:25] rescue the freaking Caesar of the empire?
[15:25 --> 15:29] Which is exactly what Julian wanted to know after the Germans got tired of the stalemate
[15:29 --> 15:30] and withdrew.
[15:30 --> 15:36] Marcellus, as I said, has his excuses, but there was absolutely no doubt in Julian's
[15:36 --> 15:42] mind that he had been hung out to dry by a disgruntled subordinate, and he wrote to Constantius
[15:42 --> 15:49] telling the emperor exactly that, and demanding that Marcellus be removed from his post.
[15:49 --> 15:53] Marcellus countered by writing a letter of his own, explaining why he had failed to do
[15:53 --> 15:55] anything about the siege.
[15:55 --> 16:00] But confirming, at least in my own mind, that Marcellus was full of it, and had indeed intentionally
[16:00 --> 16:06] left Julian hung out to dry, Constantius sided with his Caesar, and Marcellus was banished
[16:06 --> 16:10] to the Danube frontier.
[16:10 --> 16:15] Once the spring of 357 arrived, Julian was ready to put the winter struggle behind him
[16:15 --> 16:18] and go on the offensive.
[16:18 --> 16:23] In coordination with his master of the infantry, a general named Barbascio, Julian planned
[16:23 --> 16:28] a two-pronged invasion of Alamani territory along the Upper Rhine.
[16:28 --> 16:33] Julian would march due east, while Barbascio, currently in Milan, would march north through
[16:33 --> 16:35] Raetia.
[16:35 --> 16:40] They would then meet in Alamani territory and deliver some stern reprisals to the Germans
[16:40 --> 16:44] for running amok in Roman territory.
[16:44 --> 16:48] But the flying pincer move Julian envisioned fell apart immediately.
[16:48 --> 16:52] It started out well enough, but as Julian advanced, a German army crossed the Rhine
[16:52 --> 17:00] and attacked the key galaxy of Lugdunum, forcing Julian to stop and come to the city's aid.
[17:00 --> 17:05] Barbascio, meanwhile, was about to prove himself to be either incompetent or sinister, or maybe
[17:05 --> 17:07] both.
[17:07 --> 17:12] Not only had he allowed the Germans now attacking Lugdunum through the line in the first place,
[17:12 --> 17:18] but when they were finally driven off by Julian, Barbascio let them waltz right back through,
[17:18 --> 17:22] despite a clear warning from Julian that fugitive barbarians were headed his way and weighed
[17:22 --> 17:25] down with captured treasure.
[17:25 --> 17:30] As if this wasn't bad enough, a few weeks later Julian was fighting with the Alamani
[17:30 --> 17:35] and struggling to cross the Rhine, and he requested Barbascio send him seven boats
[17:35 --> 17:38] to help him make the crossing.
[17:38 --> 17:42] Barbascio was in the process of building a pontoon bridge of his own, and with more
[17:42 --> 17:46] than enough boats at his disposal, Julian figured the master of the infantry could spare
[17:46 --> 17:47] him a few.
[17:47 --> 17:54] But when he got the request, get this, rather than give Julian seven boats, Barbascio burned
[17:54 --> 17:56] seven boats.
[17:56 --> 18:00] Which just doesn't make sense on any level.
[18:00 --> 18:04] So then Julian found a fortable spot in the river and managed to drive off the Alamani
[18:04 --> 18:09] he had been facing, but when he looked around for Barbascio, who should be in the area any
[18:09 --> 18:14] second now, he discovered that his master of the infantry had been outsmarted and that
[18:14 --> 18:19] the Germans had destroyed his pontoon bridge, and so Barbascio was still on the Roman side
[18:19 --> 18:22] of the Rhine.
[18:22 --> 18:27] Left alone in German territory, Julian prudently fell back.
[18:27 --> 18:32] Undeterred, the Caesar set about trying to salvage the campaign, and so he called for
[18:32 --> 18:35] additional grain supplies from the south.
[18:35 --> 18:41] But rather than allow these grain supplies to pass through, Barbascio, again, get this,
[18:41 --> 18:45] burned the carts they were being transported on, claiming that he was afraid the shipments
[18:45 --> 18:48] would fall into enemy hands.
[18:48 --> 18:53] Then unilaterally deciding that the year's campaign season was over, Barbascio withdrew
[18:53 --> 19:00] back to Milan, leaving Julian exposed to a swarm of stirred up Germans.
[19:00 --> 19:04] So what exactly was Barbascio's deal?
[19:04 --> 19:09] Ammianus Marcellinus, the soldier historian who was serving in the legions at this point,
[19:09 --> 19:15] summed it up nicely when he said it is unresolved whether he, that is Barbascio, committed so
[19:15 --> 19:22] many monstrous acts as a result of his own vanity and self-destructiveness, or prompted
[19:22 --> 19:25] by orders of the emperor.
[19:25 --> 19:30] Coupled with Marcellus's conduct the previous winter, it does not seem exactly out of the
[19:30 --> 19:35] question to wonder if Julian's various commanders had been given explicit instructions by the
[19:35 --> 19:40] emperor to undermine his Caesar at every opportunity.
[19:40 --> 19:45] But Constantius did want the Germans bottled up, and he had sent Julian to spearhead the
[19:45 --> 19:51] operation, so it seems a little weird that he would simultaneously try to trip him up.
[19:51 --> 19:57] If he wanted Julian dead, why not just kill him like he had killed everyone else?
[19:57 --> 20:02] In all likelihood then, Marcellus, Barbascio, and the others were simply ticked off about
[20:02 --> 20:07] having to take orders from some untested youth playing soldier, and when they saw chances
[20:07 --> 20:11] to undermine him, they took them.
[20:11 --> 20:17] That and Barbascio appears to have been kind of an idiot.
[20:17 --> 20:21] But despite their efforts, Julian would not be undermined.
[20:21 --> 20:27] Indeed, it was right at this low moment, ditched by Barbascio and left stranded near Strausburg
[20:27 --> 20:34] with an undersized and ill-supplied army, that Julian won his greatest victory.
[20:34 --> 20:39] A German king named Canotamar, I have no idea if I'm pronouncing that right, took the success
[20:39 --> 20:45] the Alamani had been having that year as an opportunity to forge a coalition of six tribes
[20:45 --> 20:49] and lead them on a massive offensive.
[20:49 --> 20:55] As Julian hunkered down with the 13,000 soldiers he had left, reports came in that some 35,000
[20:55 --> 20:59] Alamani were crossing the Rhine River and heading straight for him.
[20:59 --> 21:05] Julian, choosing to force the issue now rather than face battle after a retreat that would
[21:05 --> 21:12] likely completely exhaust his already exhausted army, ordered his men forward.
[21:12 --> 21:16] Though the Romans were outnumbered, and by Romans I of course mean the Germans fighting
[21:16 --> 21:22] for Rome, the discipline that had always been the legion's calling card was still a decisive
[21:22 --> 21:27] factor and at the Battle of Strausburg, Julian had some of the best troops in the whole empire
[21:27 --> 21:32] at his disposal.
[21:32 --> 21:37] The turning point in this battle likely came before the first shot was even fired.
[21:37 --> 21:42] Always hyperprotective of the egalitarianism that they felt defined them, the German troops
[21:42 --> 21:47] demanded that Canotamar and the other chiefs dismount from their horses and fight on foot
[21:47 --> 21:50] with everyone else.
[21:50 --> 21:55] Sowing to public pressure, the German king complied, but in so doing he lost his mobility
[21:55 --> 22:00] and any sort of ability to run a coherent attack.
[22:00 --> 22:06] But then again, with 35,000 fighting 13,000, how coherent does your attack really need
[22:06 --> 22:09] to be?
[22:09 --> 22:13] Things started out well for the Germans as they managed to turn back Julian's initial
[22:13 --> 22:16] cavalry assault on their left side.
[22:16 --> 22:20] Wurtten by this success, the middle of the German line surged forward and the bloody
[22:20 --> 22:23] business of raw hand-to-hand fighting commenced.
[22:23 --> 22:29] Eventually, the sheer weight of the Germans took its toll and the German center was cut
[22:29 --> 22:31] in two.
[22:31 --> 22:36] Normally, this would be death to an army, but both split wings were able to maintain
[22:36 --> 22:40] their order and continue fighting as two separate units.
[22:40 --> 22:45] Still, things looked pretty dire for Julian and his army until the Roman back reserve
[22:45 --> 22:49] line stepped up to the plate.
[22:49 --> 22:54] After the Germans cut through the front line, they ran headlong into a solid wall of highly
[22:54 --> 23:00] trained veterans who refused to be pushed back and who refused to be split up.
[23:00 --> 23:04] So now, rather than emerging on the far side of a victorious charge with nothing left to
[23:04 --> 23:10] do but mop up the fractured Roman army, the German foot soldiers found themselves trapped
[23:10 --> 23:14] between the solid back line and the two wings of the split front line who now hemmed them
[23:14 --> 23:18] in on either side.
[23:18 --> 23:22] If Julian had been able to swing some cavalry around behind them, this all would have resembled
[23:22 --> 23:26] nothing so much as the last phase of the Battle of Cannae.
[23:26 --> 23:30] So yeah, now things looked pretty dire for the Alamani.
[23:30 --> 23:35] Finally, frustrated and dying by the hundreds, the Germans lost heart and hightailed it out
[23:35 --> 23:39] of there.
[23:39 --> 23:42] Julian ordered his own army in pursuit, but only to a point.
[23:42 --> 23:45] He told his men that when they reached the Rhine that they were not to get bogged down
[23:45 --> 23:48] by climbing into the river.
[23:48 --> 23:52] Instead, he ordered them to stay on the banks and just fire spears and arrows at the fleeing
[23:52 --> 23:54] Germans.
[23:54 --> 24:00] The estimate is that the Alamani left as many dead in that river as they had on the battlefield.
[24:00 --> 24:05] In total, 6,000 Germans died at the Battle of Strausburg.
[24:05 --> 24:11] The Romans, amazingly, lost only 243.
[24:11 --> 24:15] The cherry on top of this great victory was when Cnodomar was tracked down and brought
[24:15 --> 24:18] back in chains.
[24:18 --> 24:24] Julian dutifully sent the beaten king on to Milan for Constantius to gloat over.
[24:24 --> 24:30] The Battle of Strausburg cemented Julian's reputation as a leader to be reckoned with.
[24:30 --> 24:33] His troops now loved him.
[24:33 --> 24:36] Constantius' agents now feared him.
[24:36 --> 24:41] And that little tick in the back of the emperor's mind, the one that led him to be super paranoid
[24:41 --> 24:47] about everyone and everything, especially threats from within his own family, well,
[24:47 --> 24:52] that little tick just got real fired up.
[24:52 --> 24:57] Next time, we'll watch all of this come to a head as the relationship between Constantius
[24:57 --> 25:01] and Julian will break down completely over an order to transfer Gallic troops to the
[25:01 --> 25:05] east to help fight the resurgence of the Saunids.
[25:05 --> 25:09] Were the troops really needed, or was this all just about undermining, there's that
[25:09 --> 25:14] word again, a Caesar on the rise.
[25:14 --> 25:18] I say next time because I hate to do this to you after just being gone for so long,
[25:18 --> 25:23] but I'm flying back home for a week of family fun and I will have absolutely no time to
[25:23 --> 25:25] work on the show.
[25:25 --> 25:31] But we'll be back in two weeks to watch as Julian's troops surprisingly, and without
[25:31 --> 25:35] any prompting from me, I swear, declare Julian Augustus.

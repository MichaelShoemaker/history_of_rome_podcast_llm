[00:01 --> 00:04] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:05 --> 00:10] Last time we discussed the events that led up to the birth of Rome, covering the arrival
[00:10 --> 00:13] of Aeneas into Italy and the story of the twins Romulus and Remus.
[00:14 --> 00:19] Today we will cover the remainder of Romulus' life, his questionable morality, and his
[00:19 --> 00:21] ultimate disappearance from the world of men.
[00:23 --> 00:27] After Romulus founded the city, it became apparent that he would need to attract settlers
[00:27 --> 00:29] in order to ensure its survival.
[00:30 --> 00:34] To this end, he opened up the city to what could tactfully be described as colorful
[00:34 --> 00:38] characters, but, put simply, they were the dregs of society.
[00:39 --> 00:43] Fugitives, escaped slaves, debtors, and criminals all flocked to the new town to
[00:43 --> 00:46] start fresh, and Romulus welcomed them with open arms.
[00:48 --> 00:51] The first order of business in true Roman fashion was to establish an army.
[00:52 --> 00:56] Romulus sifted through his new subjects and divided them into able-bodied men of
[00:56 --> 00:59] military age and, well, everyone else.
[01:00 --> 01:04] Most sources agree that the first legions consisted of 3,000 foot soldiers and 300
[01:04 --> 01:09] cavalry, but accounts differ as to whether there was initially just one legion or
[01:09 --> 01:09] whether there were many.
[01:11 --> 01:15] Soldiers in those days had to equip themselves so only well-to-do citizens could enlist,
[01:16 --> 01:19] with the richest citizens serving in the cavalry because they were the only ones
[01:19 --> 01:20] who could afford horses.
[01:21 --> 01:25] This meant that the interests of the army were, in those early days, firmly
[01:25 --> 01:29] with the interests of the society it defended, at least the middle and upper classes of
[01:29 --> 01:30] that society.
[01:31 --> 01:35] In later years, the legions were filled with mercenary soldiers whose interests often
[01:35 --> 01:39] diverged from those of the actual citizens of Rome who had long since given up fighting
[01:39 --> 01:40] for themselves.
[01:41 --> 01:44] Here the seeds would be sown for civil war, decline, and ultimately destruction.
[01:45 --> 01:50] But for now, Rome's army fought for the people, not against them.
[01:51 --> 01:55] From the remaining motley assembly of those not called to arms, Romulus created a
[01:55 --> 01:59] council of one hundred senators to help him govern, either because that number was
[01:59 --> 02:03] enough for his purposes, or because there were only a hundred men respectable enough
[02:03 --> 02:05] to be given such responsibility.
[02:06 --> 02:09] The descendants of these men would become the patrician class of later Rome, who
[02:09 --> 02:13] would find themselves constantly at odds with the plebeian class, the descendants
[02:13 --> 02:15] of the remaining unwashed masses.
[02:16 --> 02:21] Rome was now ready to defend and govern itself, but there was just one problem.
[02:21 --> 02:23] The new arrivals were almost entirely male.
[02:24 --> 02:28] Without any women around, the dream of Rome would die after a single generation.
[02:29 --> 02:33] So delegations were sent around to the neighboring communities to ask for intermarriage
[02:33 --> 02:36] rights, but wherever they went they were refused.
[02:36 --> 02:40] Fathers did not want their daughters married to the Romans, who, after all, were nothing
[02:40 --> 02:43] more than a collection of despicable castoffs.
[02:43 --> 02:48] The Romans resented these rejections, and so Romulus thought up a surefire way to acquire
[02:48 --> 02:49] wives for his people.
[02:50 --> 02:51] They would steal them.
[02:53 --> 02:57] The Romans invited all the neighboring communities to a great festival honoring Neptune.
[02:58 --> 03:02] They spared no expense in preparing and promoting the celebration, and on the appointed
[03:02 --> 03:06] day, a great crowd filled Rome, including, famously, the savines.
[03:07 --> 03:13] All was going well and no one suspected a thing, until Romulus suddenly gave a
[03:15 --> 03:20] The festival was broken up and the parents of the seized women fled the city, cursing
[03:20 --> 03:21] the treachery of the Romans.
[03:22 --> 03:26] The seized women were naturally horrified at their predicament, but Romulus went to
[03:26 --> 03:30] them and claimed that it was their parents who were to blame, because they had been
[03:30 --> 03:32] too proud to wed their daughters to Roman men.
[03:33 --> 03:36] Further, he said, they would all be treated better in Rome than anywhere else, because
[03:36 --> 03:40] the Roman men would feel obligated to work off the guilt over what they had done.
[03:41 --> 03:45] Apparently this mollified the women, but it did nothing for their parents and brothers.
[03:47 --> 03:51] Attacks followed in succession from the victimized communities, but each was repelled
[03:51 --> 03:53] by Romulus and the Roman forces.
[03:54 --> 03:56] Finally, only the savines had not yet sought revenge.
[03:57 --> 04:00] They waited and planned, rather than immediately taking up arms.
[04:01 --> 04:04] When the time was right, the savines bribed a young girl to let them into the
[04:04 --> 04:07] citadel of the city, and took it before the Romans could react.
[04:08 --> 04:11] Romulus immediately mustered his army and launched a counterattack.
[04:12 --> 04:15] A brief battle was joined, but neither side could gain the upper hand.
[04:16 --> 04:20] Finally, the savine women, daughters of one side and husbands of the other, intervened,
[04:20 --> 04:23] throwing themselves between the two, pleading with them to halt.
[04:24 --> 04:27] Livy writes, We are mothers now, they cried.
[04:27 --> 04:30] Our children are your sons, your grandsons.
[04:30 --> 04:32] Do not put on them the stain of parasite.
[04:33 --> 04:38] If our marriage, if the relationship between you, is hateful to you, turn your hatred
[04:38 --> 04:39] against us.
[04:40 --> 04:41] We are the cause of strife.
[04:41 --> 04:45] On our account, our husbands and fathers lie wounded or dead, and we would rather
[04:45 --> 04:49] die ourselves than live either widowed or orphaned.
[04:50 --> 04:53] Their entreaties moved the opposing armies, and peace was made, ultimately joining
[04:53 --> 04:56] the Romans and savines into one political entity.
[04:58 --> 05:02] The abduction episode has lodged itself in the western imagination, commonly referred
[05:02 --> 05:04] to as the rape of the savine women.
[05:05 --> 05:09] The event has been depicted by countless painters, including Nicolas Poussin, Jean-Paul
[05:09 --> 05:11] Rubens, and Pablo Picasso.
[05:12 --> 05:15] Jacques-Louis David depicted the conclusion of the story in his intervention of the
[05:15 --> 05:16] savine women.
[05:17 --> 05:20] Anyone who has read Watership Down will remember that the entire second half of
[05:20 --> 05:24] the book is taken up with an adventure to secure female rabbits for the new Warren,
[05:25 --> 05:29] no doubt taking its inspiration from the Roman example, although in that case Hazel
[05:29 --> 05:32] and his followers were far more ethical in their solution.
[05:33 --> 05:38] After the savines joined with the Romans, a power-sharing agreement was reached, and
[05:38 --> 05:41] Romulus agreed to rule jointly with Tacius, the savine king.
[05:42 --> 05:46] The newly integrated citizens of the city were divided into three tribes, the first
[05:46 --> 05:51] being made of Romans, the second savines, and the third the remaining population, mostly
[05:51 --> 05:52] of Etruscan origin.
[05:53 --> 05:57] A hundred leading savines were then added to the Senate, doubling its size.
[05:58 --> 06:03] Leadership thus established, Romulus formed the first great citizen assembly, the
[06:03 --> 06:04] Camita Curiata.
[06:05 --> 06:09] To do so, he divided the tribes further into ten curiae, naming each one after
[06:09 --> 06:13] an abducted savine woman to honor them for their role in the peacemaking.
[06:14 --> 06:19] Each curiae cast one collective vote, making for thirty total, and the assembly
[06:19 --> 06:23] was tasked with electing various magistrates and enacting routine laws.
[06:24 --> 06:26] Thus the original political constitution was settled.
[06:27 --> 06:31] The kings reigned supreme, but, from the beginning, both aristocrats and commoners
[06:31 --> 06:34] were involved in the legislative and judicial functions of state.
[06:35 --> 06:38] It was at this point as well that the legions doubled in size to approximately
[06:38 --> 06:42] six thousand men, a number that would stand for the remainder of the empire.
[06:44 --> 06:47] The power-sharing agreement with Tacius lasted all of five years.
[06:48 --> 06:52] The savine king, for whatever reason, assaulted some envoys from Lavinium, and
[06:52 --> 06:56] when he later arrived in that city for routine religious services, he was set
[06:56 --> 06:57] upon by a mob and killed.
[06:58 --> 07:02] Romulus, not seeking war with Lavinia and no doubt secretly welcoming the
[07:02 --> 07:06] death of his rival, did nothing to avenge the death of his co-ruler.
[07:07 --> 07:11] The savines were outraged, but fear of Romulus's power and his apparently
[07:11 --> 07:12] divine mission held their tongues.
[07:13 --> 07:15] Romulus now reigned supreme once again.
[07:17 --> 07:20] For the next forty years, the Romans fought continuously against hostile
[07:20 --> 07:23] neighbors, usually Etruscan cities in the north.
[07:24 --> 07:28] By the time of Romulus's death, he had made the Romans a power to be reckoned with.
[07:29 --> 07:32] The details of his passing confirm his status as a mythological figure.
[07:33 --> 07:37] One day, seated on the throne, he was reviewing his troops and
[07:37 --> 07:38] a storm kicked up.
[07:38 --> 07:41] Thunder clapped and Romulus was enveloped by a cloud.
[07:42 --> 07:45] When the storm dissipated, the throne was empty and Romulus was gone.
[07:46 --> 07:49] The senators who stood beside him searched, but
[07:49 --> 07:51] no trace of Romulus was ever found.
[07:51 --> 07:55] Livy notes that Romulus was always more popular with the people than he was with
[07:55 --> 07:58] the Senate, and that it is entirely possible he was murdered by
[07:58 --> 08:00] the senators who stood beside him.
[08:00 --> 08:03] I find it part of Livy's charm that he would go out of his way to offer
[08:03 --> 08:08] a more plausible explanation for the death of such an obviously fictitious character.
[08:09 --> 08:12] The life of Romulus is a convenient myth.
[08:13 --> 08:13] Who founded Rome?
[08:14 --> 08:14] Romulus.
[08:15 --> 08:16] Where does the name come from?
[08:17 --> 08:17] Romulus.
[08:18 --> 08:19] Who organized the legions?
[08:20 --> 08:20] Romulus.
[08:21 --> 08:23] Who divided up the tribes, organized the Senate, and
[08:23 --> 08:25] began the Citizens' Assembly?
[08:25 --> 08:27] Romulus, Romulus, Romulus.
[08:28 --> 08:32] It is possible that the stories grew from the life of a real person, but
[08:32 --> 08:36] most likely Romulus was created out of necessity to answer questions later
[08:36 --> 08:37] Romans had about their own past.
[08:38 --> 08:41] It seems comically naive of the Romans to believe that so
[08:41 --> 08:43] much could be owed to a single man.
[08:43 --> 08:46] But when we look at our own almost religious veneration of George
[08:46 --> 08:48] Washington, it begins to make sense.
[08:49 --> 08:53] In 500 years, will historians be reporting that George Washington was
[08:53 --> 08:56] born of a cherry tree and had wooden teeth to prove it?
[08:56 --> 08:59] That he flew over the Delaware River, defeated the British army, and
[08:59 --> 09:01] designed the Constitution all by himself?
[09:02 --> 09:04] It seems crazy, but as time goes by,
[09:04 --> 09:08] the subtleties of actual events are compressed into small digestible units.
[09:09 --> 09:12] Horatio Gates has already been pushed from the collective consciousness,
[09:12 --> 09:14] and is known only to historians.
[09:14 --> 09:16] But it was his victory at Saratoga,
[09:16 --> 09:19] not Washington's, that led the French to support the revolution,
[09:19 --> 09:21] and thus ensure its success.
[09:22 --> 09:23] That story, though, is too complicated.
[09:24 --> 09:27] Most Americans don't even know how critical French involvement was,
[09:27 --> 09:30] let alone that Washington had little to do with securing it.
[09:31 --> 09:32] Washington beat the British.
[09:32 --> 09:34] That is the story of the American Revolution.
[09:35 --> 09:38] As the years pass, will the name of Madison be lost?
[09:38 --> 09:38] Hamilton?
[09:39 --> 09:42] Even the great Thomas Jefferson, whose fame is second to none,
[09:42 --> 09:45] may yet fall under the juggernaut that is this mythical Washington.
[09:46 --> 09:49] As he, like Romulus, becomes the answer to all questions about
[09:49 --> 09:51] the founding of America.
[09:52 --> 09:56] Countless hands working patiently over years no doubt transformed Rome from
[09:56 --> 09:58] a collection of shepherds into a regional power.
[09:58 --> 10:00] But their names have been lost, and
[10:00 --> 10:03] their deeds have been rolled into the biography of a single mythical man.
[10:05 --> 10:09] The early days of Rome stand in stark contrast to its later greatness.
[10:09 --> 10:13] To say that the mighty empire came from humble roots would be a gross
[10:13 --> 10:15] understatement and entirely misleading.
[10:16 --> 10:19] I've always found it odd that more was not done to alter the details of
[10:19 --> 10:20] Rome's unsavory beginnings.
[10:21 --> 10:25] Founded by a man who killed his own brother and was raised by a whore,
[10:25 --> 10:29] the city's initial inhabitants were thieves, crooks, and beggars.
[10:29 --> 10:32] Such an unappealing lot that they could not find a single woman who
[10:32 --> 10:34] would have them, they resorted to kidnapping.
[10:35 --> 10:36] To protect their ill-gotten wives,
[10:36 --> 10:39] they then proceeded to make war on their new in-laws.
[10:39 --> 10:42] There was not a single sympathetic figure in the whole bunch.
[10:42 --> 10:44] You almost find yourself rooting for
[10:44 --> 10:47] the Etruscans to put this rabble down and restore some decency to the world.
[10:48 --> 10:50] But alas, the Romans were strong and
[10:50 --> 10:53] would not be conquered, even if they were total bastards.
[10:54 --> 10:55] And this is the moral of Rome's birth.
[10:56 --> 11:00] The Romans won and grew and thrived, not because they were right or good or
[11:00 --> 11:04] moral or God's chosen people, but because they were strong and
[11:04 --> 11:05] knew how to win in battle.
[11:06 --> 11:10] Might may not make right, but it will make a thousand year civilization.
[11:10 --> 11:15] Join me next time as we discuss Romulus' successors to the throne,
[11:16 --> 11:19] Rome's religious awakening, and how the kings were finally run out of town.

[00:03 --> 00:06] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:13] So far, we have covered four of the seven kings of Rome, Romulus, Pneuma Pompulius,
[00:14 --> 00:16] Tellus Hostilius, and Ancus Martius.
[00:16 --> 00:21] Today we will discuss the final three, the so-called Tarquin dynasty, the father
[00:21 --> 00:27] Tarquinius Priscus, a decent, if manipulative, king, his adopted son and successor Servius
[00:27 --> 00:31] Tellius, and finally his real son, Tarquinius Superbus, who usurped his adopted
[00:31 --> 00:36] brother and was then himself usurped by a fed-up mob, marking him forever with the
[00:36 --> 00:38] infamy of being the last king of Rome.
[00:39 --> 00:44] Lucius Tarquinius Priscus was born in Tarquini, one of the twelve cities of Atruria, the
[00:44 --> 00:46] son of a Corinthian exile named Demaratus.
[00:47 --> 00:51] Tarquin, the name by which history remembers him, was a shrewd businessman who became
[00:51 --> 00:55] wealthy, but due to his racially mixed heritage, he was only admitted so far
[00:55 --> 00:57] up the Etruscan social and political ladder.
[00:58 --> 01:03] Angered at being denied the respect he felt he deserved, he decided to move to Rome,
[01:03 --> 01:05] a city famous for offering men a fresh start.
[01:06 --> 01:09] In Rome, Tarquin made an immediate splash.
[01:09 --> 01:14] He gave lavishly, funding public projects, charities, and anything else that would bring
[01:14 --> 01:14] him renown.
[01:15 --> 01:18] It did not take long for Tarquin to come to the attention of Ancus Martius,
[01:18 --> 01:19] the aging king.
[01:19 --> 01:23] In his final years, Ancus brought Tarquin into his confidence, leading to a close
[01:23 --> 01:28] relationship that resulted in Tarquin ultimately being made guardian of Ancus's two sons when
[01:28 --> 01:29] the king died.
[01:30 --> 01:34] Tarquin knew an opportunity when he saw it, and after Ancus died, he sent the
[01:34 --> 01:35] two boys away on a hunting trip.
[01:36 --> 01:40] He then lobbied the Senate to hold elections for a new king immediately to avoid any
[01:40 --> 01:43] possible threat to the city brought on by the vacuum in leadership.
[01:44 --> 01:47] Tarquin had made a lot of friends in the short time he had been in Rome, and
[01:47 --> 01:50] his further generosity no doubt convinced any fence-sitters that he was the man
[01:50 --> 01:51] for the job.
[01:52 --> 01:55] He was selected in a landslide and became the fifth king of Rome.
[01:57 --> 02:01] One of his first acts, demonstrating his characteristic shrewdness, was to expand the
[02:01 --> 02:04] Senate by another hundred men, bringing their total number to 300.
[02:05 --> 02:10] The new senators were wholly obligated to Tarquin for their positions and, predictably,
[02:10 --> 02:14] supported him in everything that he did, leaving the Senate little more than a rubber
[02:14 --> 02:16] stamp for Tarquin's policies.
[02:16 --> 02:20] This could have proven disastrous if Tarquin had been an incompetent or tyrannical
[02:20 --> 02:25] leader, but he proved to be a conscientious and able king, both as an administrator and
[02:25 --> 02:26] military commander.
[02:28 --> 02:32] Soon after his election, Rome found itself at war, again, with some of its Latin
[02:32 --> 02:32] neighbors.
[02:33 --> 02:36] Tarquin easily routed his opponents and returned to Rome with a great deal of plunder.
[02:37 --> 02:41] He decided to celebrate his victory by throwing public games the likes of which
[02:41 --> 02:42] had never been seen.
[02:42 --> 02:46] But there was no stadium large enough for Tarquin's vision, so he ordered a hippodrome
[02:46 --> 02:48] built between the Palatine and Aventine hills.
[02:49 --> 02:54] This hippodrome, when completed, would become known as the Circus Maximus, one of the greatest
[02:54 --> 02:56] sports venues in the ancient world.
[02:56 --> 03:00] It would remain in continuous use for the thousand-year existence of the empire.
[03:01 --> 03:05] Immediately after work began on the Circus Maximus, Rome found itself embroiled in
[03:05 --> 03:08] a fight with the remaining independent Sabine communities.
[03:08 --> 03:11] They had never gotten over having half their population annexed by the Romans
[03:11 --> 03:15] and now sought to challenge the upstart for control of the region.
[03:15 --> 03:20] Tarquin again led the Romans to victory, defeating the Sabines with strategy as well
[03:20 --> 03:21] as brute force.
[03:21 --> 03:25] Destroying a bridge the Sabines had used to cross into Roman territory, cutting off
[03:25 --> 03:27] any escape route, he then smashed them against the river.
[03:28 --> 03:33] To celebrate this victory, Tarquin inaugurated one of the most famous of all Roman traditions,
[03:33 --> 03:34] the Triumph.
[03:35 --> 03:38] Later years would set guidelines for what constituted an official triumph, but the
[03:38 --> 03:40] basic parts were put in place by Tarquin.
[03:40 --> 03:45] The leader of the victorious army rides into the city on a chariot drawn by four horses.
[03:46 --> 03:50] The legions follow with prisoners of the vanquished army and all manner of plunder
[03:50 --> 03:51] seized from the enemy.
[03:51 --> 03:55] To be awarded a Triumph was the greatest honor a Roman general could receive.
[03:55 --> 03:59] More will be said later about the traditional elements of a Triumph, so for now we will
[03:59 --> 04:03] simply note for trivia's sake that it was Tarquinius Priscus who celebrated the
[04:03 --> 04:03] first one.
[04:05 --> 04:08] Right around this time a fantastic story reached the king.
[04:08 --> 04:12] The head of a slave's sleeping child had suddenly burst into flames, though the child
[04:12 --> 04:15] remained unhurt and did not wake up.
[04:15 --> 04:18] Witnesses testified that they had seen the event with their own eyes and that
[04:18 --> 04:21] the flames only disappeared when the child awoke.
[04:21 --> 04:25] Tarquin's wife believed it was an omen of the child's future greatness and implored
[04:25 --> 04:29] the king to adopt him so as to invite destiny into their house and not have
[04:29 --> 04:30] it break down their doors.
[04:31 --> 04:34] Tarquin agreed and the child, Servius Tullius, was adopted by the king.
[04:35 --> 04:39] He raised the boy as his own and the omen bore out as the boy grew into a
[04:39 --> 04:41] capable leader and eventual heir apparent to the throne.
[04:43 --> 04:45] All was progressing nicely for Tarquin, but trouble was brewing.
[04:46 --> 04:49] The sons of Ancus had not forgotten how Tarquin denied them their birthright
[04:49 --> 04:52] and resolved to reclaim what they felt was theirs.
[04:53 --> 04:56] Knowing they could never get close to the king, the brothers enticed two
[04:56 --> 04:57] men to do their dirty work for them.
[04:58 --> 05:01] The two men arrived at the palace and pretended to have a loud quarrel,
[05:01 --> 05:04] eventually demanding the king settle their dispute.
[05:05 --> 05:07] Tarquin came to see what all the commotion was about and
[05:07 --> 05:08] agreed to settle the fight.
[05:08 --> 05:12] But as he sat to adjudicate, one of the men pulled out an axe he had hidden
[05:12 --> 05:15] in his robe and lodged it in the back of the king's head.
[05:16 --> 05:18] Tarquin fell and the two men attempted to escape, but
[05:18 --> 05:20] they were immediately captured.
[05:21 --> 05:24] Tarquin's wife, Tanquil, seeing the severity of the wound,
[05:24 --> 05:27] immediately cleared the room and brought Servius Tullius in to help
[05:27 --> 05:28] her tend to the king.
[05:28 --> 05:32] Over the body she told Servius that nothing could be done for Tarquin, but
[05:32 --> 05:35] that it was imperative the men responsible for the crime should not sit
[05:35 --> 05:35] on the throne.
[05:36 --> 05:39] She implored Servius to take part in a charade to guarantee that neither
[05:39 --> 05:41] of Ancus's sons would ever be king.
[05:42 --> 05:45] Throwing open a window and addressing the crowd that had by this time
[05:45 --> 05:49] gathered, Tanquil told them that her husband's wound was only superficial
[05:49 --> 05:51] and that the king would be back on his feet soon.
[05:52 --> 05:54] In the meantime, she told them to obey Servius,
[05:54 --> 05:57] who would act as king until Tarquin could resume his duties.
[05:57 --> 06:00] At this point, of course, the king was already dead.
[06:01 --> 06:05] Tarquin ran 37 years and died in 579 BC.
[06:06 --> 06:09] Servius performed the duties of king for a time as if he was merely
[06:09 --> 06:12] acting in Tarquin's stead, going so far as to reserve judgment
[06:12 --> 06:16] in some legal disputes, claiming that he must consult with the king.
[06:16 --> 06:19] The sons of Ancus, believing their plot had failed and seeing
[06:19 --> 06:22] Servius secure on the throne, went into exile.
[06:22 --> 06:24] Not long after the transfer of power,
[06:24 --> 06:28] VA launched an attack on Rome and Servius marched to meet them.
[06:28 --> 06:32] Completely destroying the Viet army, Servius returned to Rome, a beloved savior.
[06:33 --> 06:35] At this point, clearly in command of the throne,
[06:35 --> 06:37] the death of Tarquin was announced.
[06:38 --> 06:40] No one questioned Servius's continued reign as king
[06:40 --> 06:44] and the plan hatched by Tanquil was brought to a successful conclusion.
[06:45 --> 06:47] Servius would be the second to last king of Rome
[06:47 --> 06:49] and by all accounts, the last good one.
[06:49 --> 06:53] He was responsible for the final reconfiguration of Roman society
[06:53 --> 06:55] prior to the establishment of the Republic,
[06:55 --> 06:57] a reconfiguration that would have a profound effect
[06:57 --> 07:00] on the way that Republic would ultimately be governed.
[07:01 --> 07:04] Desiring to take stock of the city's resources, wealth, and population,
[07:04 --> 07:06] he instituted the first census.
[07:07 --> 07:10] Based upon the data he received, he divided landowning Romans,
[07:10 --> 07:12] known as the Sidui, into five classes.
[07:13 --> 07:16] Nominally divided by wealth, the idea was to establish
[07:16 --> 07:19] who could provide what when war inevitably came knocking.
[07:20 --> 07:23] The first class was the richest, able to provide a helmet,
[07:23 --> 07:27] round shield, bronze breastplate, leg armor, sword, and spear.
[07:27 --> 07:30] The second class provided all the same equipment as the first,
[07:30 --> 07:31] save for the breastplate.
[07:32 --> 07:34] The third provided the same as the second, but for the leg armor.
[07:35 --> 07:38] Only a spear and javelin were required of the fourth class
[07:38 --> 07:41] and the fifth provided merely slings and stones.
[07:42 --> 07:44] Sandwiching these classes were the richest of the rich,
[07:44 --> 07:47] already separately designated as equites,
[07:47 --> 07:50] cavalrymen able to provide horses, and the poorest of the poor,
[07:51 --> 07:54] i.e. most of the population, who were exempted from military service.
[07:55 --> 07:59] Men aged 18 to 40 from the five classes formed the legions
[07:59 --> 08:01] when the need, which was often, arose.
[08:03 --> 08:05] The classes did not serve a strictly military function.
[08:06 --> 08:08] They also formed the basis of the new Roman electoral college.
[08:09 --> 08:13] The old tribal assembly created by Romulus, the comita curiata,
[08:13 --> 08:16] was surpassed by Servius' new comita, Centuriata.
[08:17 --> 08:20] Each of the classes were further divided into centuries
[08:20 --> 08:21] which voted as blocks.
[08:22 --> 08:24] The centuries, however, were not equal in size.
[08:24 --> 08:26] The first class, which was the smallest,
[08:27 --> 08:28] was divided into 80 centuries.
[08:29 --> 08:31] The second, third, and fourth classes each had 20.
[08:32 --> 08:34] The fifth, by far the largest, was composed of 30.
[08:35 --> 08:38] The small group of equites were divided into 12 centuries,
[08:39 --> 08:41] and the landless masses were granted just one.
[08:42 --> 08:44] Elections being determined by a simple majority,
[08:45 --> 08:47] the equites in the first class held between them
[08:47 --> 08:49] all the votes they needed to control who would hold office
[08:49 --> 08:51] and what policies would be pursued.
[08:52 --> 08:55] There was some logic to the wildly skewed voting system.
[08:56 --> 08:58] The wealthy shouldered the financial burdens
[08:58 --> 08:59] of both state and military,
[08:59 --> 09:01] and thus felt entirely justified
[09:01 --> 09:02] in their stranglehold on power.
[09:03 --> 09:05] The bulk of the population, however,
[09:05 --> 09:07] would come to view the system as entirely unjust
[09:07 --> 09:09] and would eventually have to take drastic steps
[09:09 --> 09:11] for their voices to be heard.
[09:12 --> 09:14] Servius' reign was progressing nicely.
[09:14 --> 09:16] The Latin communities even contributed funds
[09:16 --> 09:18] to build a temple to Diana in Rome,
[09:18 --> 09:19] admitting once and for all
[09:19 --> 09:21] that Rome was the capital of Latium.
[09:22 --> 09:23] However, all was not well.
[09:24 --> 09:26] Just as Ancus' sons were the undoing of Tarquin,
[09:27 --> 09:29] so would the sons of Tarquin be the undoing of Servius.
[09:30 --> 09:32] Servius believed he had covered this obvious threat
[09:32 --> 09:35] by marrying his daughters to the two Tarquin boys,
[09:35 --> 09:36] Lucius and Arunes.
[09:36 --> 09:38] But this was not enough for Lucius,
[09:38 --> 09:40] who felt he had been tricked out of his rightful succession,
[09:41 --> 09:42] though his new wife was noncommittal
[09:42 --> 09:44] about this alleged injustice.
[09:45 --> 09:46] His brother Arunes,
[09:46 --> 09:47] who could not have cared one way or the other,
[09:48 --> 09:50] found himself married to a woman, Tullia,
[09:50 --> 09:52] who resented his lack of ambition
[09:52 --> 09:53] and admired Lucius' drive.
[09:54 --> 09:56] Tullia further despised her own sister
[09:56 --> 09:58] for not supporting an obviously great man
[09:58 --> 09:59] in his quest for the throne.
[10:00 --> 10:01] Evil took hold of them,
[10:01 --> 10:03] and not being particularly creative,
[10:03 --> 10:05] they decided to simply kill their unwanted mates
[10:05 --> 10:06] so they could be together
[10:06 --> 10:08] and pursue the crown at full throttle.
[10:10 --> 10:12] The newlyweds began a whisper campaign against Servius,
[10:13 --> 10:14] pointing out his low birth
[10:14 --> 10:16] and the fact that he had never been truly elected.
[10:17 --> 10:18] To the richest in Rome,
[10:18 --> 10:20] they alleged that the census was no more than a trick
[10:20 --> 10:21] to expose their wealth
[10:21 --> 10:23] so Servius could snatch it up
[10:23 --> 10:25] and hand it over to his lowborn friends.
[10:26 --> 10:28] Lucius grew ever more bold as he gained support
[10:28 --> 10:31] until finally he decided to make his move.
[10:31 --> 10:33] He went to the palace while Servius was away
[10:33 --> 10:35] and sat upon the throne,
[10:35 --> 10:37] demanding that the Senate assemble before him.
[10:38 --> 10:38] When they did,
[10:39 --> 10:40] out of a mixture of fear and confusion,
[10:41 --> 10:42] he demanded they kneel before him
[10:42 --> 10:43] and hail him King Tarquin.
[10:44 --> 10:46] He was in the midst of a lengthy speech
[10:46 --> 10:48] degrading Servius when the old king appeared,
[10:48 --> 10:49] demanding an explanation.
[10:50 --> 10:52] A scuffle ensued between the supporters of Tarquin
[10:52 --> 10:54] and those loyal to Servius,
[10:54 --> 10:55] and in the melee,
[10:55 --> 10:57] the old king himself was struck and killed.
[10:58 --> 11:02] Servius had reigned 43 years and died in 535 BC.
[11:03 --> 11:04] Lucius would become known to history
[11:04 --> 11:07] as Tarquinius Superbus or Tarquin the Proud,
[11:07 --> 11:08] the last King of Rome.
[11:10 --> 11:13] From the start, Tarquin was the very model of a tyrant.
[11:13 --> 11:15] He was vain, arrogant, pompous,
[11:16 --> 11:18] and dismissive of both the people and the Senate.
[11:19 --> 11:21] He built monuments to himself at the expense of the rich
[11:21 --> 11:23] using the labor of the poor.
[11:23 --> 11:26] Smart enough to understand his shaky position,
[11:26 --> 11:28] having seized power without so much as a nod
[11:28 --> 11:29] to electoral formalities,
[11:29 --> 11:31] he chose fear as the basis for his reign.
[11:32 --> 11:34] He claimed for himself all legislative
[11:34 --> 11:37] and judicial functions and dared anyone to oppose him.
[11:38 --> 11:40] Those who did quickly regretted their choice.
[11:40 --> 11:43] Tarquin arrested, tried, and executed his opponents,
[11:43 --> 11:46] completely bypassing the traditional court system.
[11:46 --> 11:49] He confiscated property whenever he saw fit
[11:49 --> 11:51] and arbitrarily reduced the ranks of the Senate,
[11:51 --> 11:54] leaving it anemic and unable to counter his actions.
[11:55 --> 11:58] Tarquin's misconduct was not confined to the city itself.
[11:59 --> 12:01] He sought to consolidate Rome's power over Latium
[12:01 --> 12:04] into this end called the Council of the Local Nobility.
[12:05 --> 12:07] He let them sit all day without making an appearance
[12:07 --> 12:08] until one of them rose to declare
[12:08 --> 12:10] that Tarquin was making them wait on purpose
[12:10 --> 12:12] to show that he could order them around at will.
[12:13 --> 12:15] Just then, Tarquin finally appeared.
[12:15 --> 12:18] The King made note of the man who had spoken against him
[12:18 --> 12:19] and, after the meeting broke up,
[12:20 --> 12:21] bribed one of the noble slaves
[12:21 --> 12:23] to plant a cache of weapons in his master's room.
[12:24 --> 12:26] The deed done, Tarquin recalled the Council
[12:26 --> 12:28] and announced that he had just discovered a plot
[12:28 --> 12:31] against his life and fingered the offensive noble
[12:31 --> 12:32] as its leader.
[12:32 --> 12:34] They marched as a group to where the noble was staying
[12:34 --> 12:36] and discovered the hidden weapons.
[12:36 --> 12:39] That, coupled with his speech from the day before,
[12:39 --> 12:40] was enough to frame the poor man
[12:40 --> 12:42] and he was immediately executed
[12:42 --> 12:43] without so much as a trial.
[12:44 --> 12:46] The remaining Latin nobility,
[12:46 --> 12:48] whether they believed the charges or not,
[12:48 --> 12:50] believed that Tarquin was capable of almost anything
[12:50 --> 12:53] and so did nothing to challenge his position in Rome.
[12:54 --> 12:56] The city and surrounding countryside thus pacified.
[12:56 --> 12:59] Tarquin sat back to enjoy the fruits of his labor,
[12:59 --> 13:02] but only poisoned fruit can grow from such poisonous seeds
[13:02 --> 13:04] and Tarquin would soon pay the ultimate price
[13:04 --> 13:06] for his underhanded tactics.
[13:07 --> 13:10] Tarquin, obviously, had engendered no goodwill
[13:10 --> 13:13] in the city and the population waited only for a spark
[13:13 --> 13:14] to light them into full revolt.
[13:15 --> 13:17] Tarquin's own son would provide that spark.
[13:18 --> 13:21] The young man, Sextus, was invited to a dinner party
[13:21 --> 13:23] hosted by Colatinus, a local noble,
[13:23 --> 13:26] and upon meeting Lucretia, the lady of the house,
[13:27 --> 13:29] Sextus decided that he must have her.
[13:29 --> 13:31] Enflamed with lust, he returned to the house
[13:31 --> 13:33] while Colatinus was off laying seeds
[13:33 --> 13:36] to the nearby town of Ardea and raped her.
[13:36 --> 13:39] His lust faded, Sextus rode off unaware
[13:39 --> 13:40] of what he had set in motion.
[13:41 --> 13:43] Colatinus, riding back to Rome
[13:43 --> 13:45] with a certain Lucius Junius Brutus,
[13:45 --> 13:47] was met by a messenger who bid him
[13:47 --> 13:48] return to his house at once.
[13:48 --> 13:52] There, surrounded by her father, Colatinus and Brutus,
[13:52 --> 13:54] Lucretia told him what Sextus had done
[13:54 --> 13:57] and then, overwhelmed by shame, grabbed a knife
[13:57 --> 13:58] and stabbed herself in the heart.
[13:59 --> 14:02] The three men, grief-stricken, stood over her body
[14:02 --> 14:04] and swore that the Tarquins would pay for her death.
[14:05 --> 14:07] Returning at once to the encamped army at Ardea,
[14:08 --> 14:10] Brutus raised them into revolt with a stirring speech
[14:10 --> 14:12] denouncing the Tarquins as oppressive criminals.
[14:13 --> 14:14] He then led the army back to Rome
[14:14 --> 14:17] where he planned to expel the Tarquins once and for all.
[14:18 --> 14:20] Arriving in the city, he marched through the streets
[14:20 --> 14:22] and found a population slaving away
[14:22 --> 14:25] on Tarquin's various pet projects and ready for revolution.
[14:26 --> 14:29] Tarquin, at this point, having heard of the mutiny in Ardea,
[14:29 --> 14:31] had ridden out to take control of the situation
[14:32 --> 14:34] but instead found his army gone
[14:34 --> 14:37] and himself in exile from the city he allegedly ruled.
[14:38 --> 14:40] Tarquinia's superbus reigned 24 years
[14:40 --> 14:43] and would die seeking but never regaining the throne.
[14:45 --> 14:47] Back in the city, the liberated people declared
[14:47 --> 14:49] the Tarquins enemies of the state
[14:49 --> 14:51] and forever barred them from Rome.
[14:51 --> 14:53] The comitas and chariata was convened
[14:53 --> 14:56] and it was decided that kings should never again rule Rome
[14:56 --> 14:59] and that two men should be elected annually to be leaders
[14:59 --> 15:01] so the power could never again be concentrated
[15:01 --> 15:03] in the hands of a single man.
[15:04 --> 15:05] Colatinus and Brutus were duly elected
[15:05 --> 15:08] and were inaugurated as the first two consuls
[15:08 --> 15:09] in Roman history.
[15:09 --> 15:12] The year was 509 BC and the most famous republic
[15:12 --> 15:14] in the history of the world was born.
[15:16 --> 15:18] The story of the ill-fated Tarquin dynasty
[15:18 --> 15:21] casts an interesting shadow over Roman history.
[15:21 --> 15:24] Through the obviously apocryphal royal biographies,
[15:24 --> 15:27] a general outline of actual history begins to emerge.
[15:28 --> 15:31] As I said in part one, Roman culture was derived largely
[15:31 --> 15:33] from Etruscan and Greek influences
[15:33 --> 15:35] so as an instructive parallel,
[15:35 --> 15:37] we are given the story of a family of kings
[15:37 --> 15:40] who became masters of Rome after emigrating from Atruria
[15:40 --> 15:42] and were descended from an exiled Greek.
[15:43 --> 15:45] There, in the micro story of the Tarquins
[15:45 --> 15:47] is the macro story of all Rome.
[15:48 --> 15:52] This dramatic, if fictitious account has roots in reality.
[15:52 --> 15:54] Modern historians recognize the dominance
[15:54 --> 15:57] Atruria had over Rome until the founding of the republic.
[15:58 --> 16:00] It is thought that Etruscan kings did indeed command Rome
[16:00 --> 16:03] and that they were rejected by a native population
[16:03 --> 16:04] wary of their rule.
[16:04 --> 16:05] Though the neatness of this account
[16:05 --> 16:08] no doubt misses a reality filled with intermarriage
[16:08 --> 16:10] and colliding cultures, making it hard to know
[16:10 --> 16:13] who was a native Roman and who was a foreign Etruscan.
[16:14 --> 16:16] The story of the kings also offers a moral
[16:16 --> 16:18] that the Romans followed to great success
[16:18 --> 16:20] and abandoned at their peril.
[16:20 --> 16:23] Until the ill-fated Tarquinius Superbus,
[16:23 --> 16:25] none of the kings had been the son of a previous ruler.
[16:26 --> 16:28] Hereditary succession played almost no part
[16:28 --> 16:29] in the ascension of the kings.
[16:30 --> 16:32] Anx Martius was the only one who was even related
[16:32 --> 16:34] to one of his predecessors
[16:34 --> 16:37] and he was the grandson of Numa, not an immediate heir.
[16:37 --> 16:40] This stands in stark contrast to the monarchies
[16:40 --> 16:41] that emerged in the middle ages
[16:41 --> 16:44] that were founded entirely on the passing of power
[16:44 --> 16:45] from father to son,
[16:45 --> 16:47] whatever the merits or abilities of the child.
[16:48 --> 16:50] Gibbon famously marks the beginning
[16:50 --> 16:51] of the end of the Roman Empire
[16:51 --> 16:53] with Marcus Aurelius' sentimental choice
[16:53 --> 16:57] of his son Commodus and not another more capable man
[16:57 --> 16:59] to succeed the Imperium in 177 AD.
[17:00 --> 17:03] The choice ended five successive transfers of power
[17:03 --> 17:05] from the emperor to a man chosen on merit
[17:05 --> 17:06] and not relation.
[17:07 --> 17:09] The hundred year period of the so-called
[17:09 --> 17:11] five good emperors marked the height
[17:11 --> 17:13] of Roman power, wealth and stability.
[17:14 --> 17:16] History has shown again and again
[17:16 --> 17:18] that the ship of state is well sailed
[17:18 --> 17:20] when leadership is based on great ability
[17:20 --> 17:21] and run against the rocks
[17:21 --> 17:23] when it is based upon mere birth.
[17:25 --> 17:28] The Roman monarchy was now dead, never to return.
[17:29 --> 17:32] Next, we move on to the story of the Roman Republic
[17:32 --> 17:35] and trace its long march through the Italian peninsula
[17:35 --> 17:38] across the Mediterranean and into legend.
[17:40 --> 17:41] Next week, we will discuss the first days
[17:41 --> 17:44] of the Republic, who its initial leaders were
[17:44 --> 17:46] and what would happen to any man
[17:46 --> 17:49] who ever again tried to make himself king of Rome.

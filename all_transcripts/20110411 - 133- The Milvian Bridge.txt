[00:59 --> 01:11] forward slash Rome so that they know who sent you. Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome,
[01:11 --> 01:21] episode 133, The Milvian Bridge. Last week, we laid the groundwork for Constantine's showdown
[01:21 --> 01:26] with Maxentius, a showdown that would culminate with the epic battle of the Milvian Bridge,
[01:26 --> 01:33] a battle that has gone down as one of the most important in world history. As momentous an event
[01:33 --> 01:38] as it was though, it is important to keep in mind that at the time, there was absolutely no
[01:38 --> 01:44] indication that the battle would take on such enormous significance down the road. At the time,
[01:44 --> 01:50] it was just another clash in the tetrarchies running civil war, a clash fought between two
[01:50 --> 01:56] ambitious men who wielded a great deal of power and wanted to wield a great deal more. It was not
[01:56 --> 02:02] yet seen as a monumental battle between Christianity and paganism, and Constantine's victory was not
[02:02 --> 02:09] yet being painted as the inevitable victory of God over the gods. Constantine's victory over
[02:09 --> 02:16] Maxentius was a big deal. After all, it left him in sole control of the Western Empire. But it was
[02:16 --> 02:21] a big deal only in the limited sense of how much it strengthened his position relative to
[02:21 --> 02:27] Maximinus Dio and Lichinus, his partners in-slash-rivals for power. Had things turned
[02:27 --> 02:32] out differently, that is, had Constantine not eventually wound up on top, the fact that prior
[02:32 --> 02:38] to some ultimately irrelevant battle he had his men paint some random symbol on their shields would
[02:38 --> 02:44] not have mattered at all. But he did wind up on top, and so it does matter. And because down the
[02:44 --> 02:48] road the Battle of the Milvian Bridge will be pointed to as the moment when the Christianization
[02:48 --> 02:58] of the Western world really got going, it matters a lot. Nowhere was the non-inevitability of
[02:58 --> 03:04] Constantine's victory more acutely felt than in his inner circle. Having determined that the best
[03:04 --> 03:10] way to handle Maxentius would be to remain in Gaul, there was much consternation in the spring of 312
[03:10 --> 03:16] as they found themselves instead organizing the invasion of Italy. Nothing, they felt, could have
[03:16 --> 03:23] played more into Maxentius' hands. Constantine's forces would be numerically inferior, they would
[03:23 --> 03:29] be fighting on Maxentius' turf, and perhaps most importantly of all, they would be giving Maxentius
[03:29 --> 03:34] a chance to win before his domestic political troubles had a chance to bring him down without
[03:34 --> 03:40] Constantine needing to lift a finger. Because word on the street was that the Romans were not as hot
[03:40 --> 03:47] on Maxentius as they had once been. The masses had supported him initially because they basically
[03:47 --> 03:53] supported anyone who brought the bread and circuses, but years of estrangement from Africa and the
[03:53 --> 03:58] consequent disruption of the bread part of that equation had more or less soured the mob on their
[03:58 --> 04:04] emperor. The aristocracy had backed him initially because they believed that he would help restore
[04:04 --> 04:09] their ancient privileges, but instead he was taxing them harder and faster than the Tetrarchy
[04:09 --> 04:16] had. In Maxentius' defense, he had an army to pay for, and a government to pay for, and infrastructure
[04:16 --> 04:21] projects to pay for, and unlike emperors past, he wasn't able to offset these costs with provincial
[04:21 --> 04:28] taxes. But still, after five years in power, he had pretty much alienated all of his subjects.
[04:28 --> 04:36] Now it should be obvious why he had an army to pay for and a government to pay for, but what of
[04:36 --> 04:42] these infrastructure projects of which you speak? If heavy taxation was threatening his political
[04:42 --> 04:49] position, why indulge in public works projects? The answer is that Maxentius thought that he was
[04:49 --> 04:55] actually shoring up his political position rather than undermining it. It had been a long time since
[04:55 --> 05:01] an emperor, or whatever Maxentius was, had taken a keen interest in the architectural well-being of
[05:01 --> 05:07] the capital, and Maxentius figured that that meant he had a golden opportunity to put his own stamp
[05:07 --> 05:12] on the Eternal City, provide excellent new public spaces for the population, and leave future
[05:12 --> 05:19] generations remembering how great and wonderful Maxentius had been. And though that last bit had
[05:19 --> 05:23] to take a detour through Constantine's co-option of all these projects following the Battle of the
[05:23 --> 05:29] Milvian Bridge, Maxentius was successful in making his stamp on the Eternal City permanent,
[05:29 --> 05:34] as visitors to the forum still marvel today at the remains of the Basilica of Maxentius,
[05:34 --> 05:41] one of the largest freestanding buildings the Romans ever built. But though in the long run
[05:41 --> 05:47] his projects were seen as a net positive, right now they were too much drain and not enough gain,
[05:47 --> 05:53] leaving many of the elites in Rome not exactly adverse to the idea of a Constantine victory.
[05:53 --> 05:59] This, coupled with the lingering resentment of the masses who were still angry about the food
[05:59 --> 06:06] shortages, left Maxentius in a precarious position politically, which is why Constantine's advisors
[06:06 --> 06:11] wanted to wait and let nature take its course. But Constantine was determined to invade,
[06:11 --> 06:15] possibly because he knew that God was on his side.
[06:15 --> 06:22] Leaving the majority of his troops behind to keep an eye on the frontiers,
[06:22 --> 06:27] Constantine marched through the Alps in the spring of 312 with a force of about 40,000 men,
[06:27 --> 06:33] representing roughly one quarter of all his available troops. But, critically,
[06:33 --> 06:40] less than half of the 100,000-man army Maxentius had at his disposal. So it's a good thing God was
[06:40 --> 06:48] on his side, because otherwise Constantine's plan looked a little kooky. But God was not the
[06:48 --> 06:54] only thing Constantine had on his side. His 40,000 men were highly trained veteran soldiers,
[06:54 --> 07:02] mostly German, and intensely loyal to Constantine. By contrast, Maxentius's 100,000 men were mostly
[07:02 --> 07:10] raw recruits, whose loyalty to Maxentius was dubious at best. So maybe Constantine wasn't resting
[07:10 --> 07:18] all his hopes on the grace of God. The first Italian city Constantine hid on the east side
[07:18 --> 07:23] of the Alps was a fortified town called Segucium. And though it made a show of resisting, there was
[07:23 --> 07:30] very little they could do, and soon they were at Constantine's mercy. But after burning down the
[07:30 --> 07:35] gate and capturing the town, Constantine demonstrated to everyone, friend and foe alike,
[07:35 --> 07:41] exactly what kind of conqueror he planned to be, and he ordered his men to refrain from any
[07:41 --> 07:47] plundering. This, of course, stood in stark contrast to Galerius's punitive march through
[07:47 --> 07:56] Italy back in 307. Constantine was trying to win a military campaign, yes, but winning the political
[07:56 --> 08:02] campaign was even more important. In the opening skirmish of the war, then, he had scored a minor
[08:02 --> 08:08] victory in the former, but a huge victory in the latter. A victory that would lay the groundwork
[08:08 --> 08:15] for the rest of the campaign. The first significant fighting took place a bit further east, near the
[08:15 --> 08:21] modern city of Torino, where a formidable contingent of Maxentius's cavalry pounced on
[08:21 --> 08:27] Constantine's marching army. But Constantine was able to successfully flank them, and Maxentius's
[08:27 --> 08:33] forces were driven off. The defeated horsemen made for Torino, but the inhabitants of the city
[08:33 --> 08:38] refused to open the gates to them, forcing Maxentius's men out of the region completely.
[08:38 --> 08:44] Constantine then marched unchallenged to Milan, where the gates were thrown open and he was
[08:44 --> 08:51] welcomed by a cheering crowd. Yes, the military war was going fine, but the political war was
[08:51 --> 08:59] going great. Constantine then remained in Milan for a bit, consolidating his position and resting
[08:59 --> 09:05] his men, because though it had been pretty easy going so far, no one had any illusions that the
[09:05 --> 09:13] going was going to stay this easy. The first real test came in mid-summer, when Constantine advanced
[09:13 --> 09:21] east to face Maxentius's main forward army, led by the capable Praetorian prefect Ruricius Pompeianus.
[09:21 --> 09:28] The same man who had been dispatched to Africa to take down Domitius Alexander. Ruricius had
[09:28 --> 09:33] holed up in the modern city of Verona, which was easily defensible as it was bounded on three sides
[09:33 --> 09:41] by a river, and he was essentially daring Constantine to try and dislodge him. Constantine took the dare
[09:41 --> 09:46] and sent a detachment of men around north of the city, with orders to cross the river unnoticed
[09:46 --> 09:53] and slip over the relatively under-Garrison north wall. However, Ruricius was alerted to the
[09:53 --> 10:01] maneuver and sent a force in to quash the attempt. But his much larger force was somehow defeated by
[10:01 --> 10:08] Constantine's small expedition. This is about the time when God really starts to enter the equation,
[10:08 --> 10:15] because Constantine is about to make a habit of winning despite being vastly outnumbered. Then
[10:15 --> 10:21] again, maybe it was just a matter of the relative quality of the soldiers on each side. Then again,
[10:21 --> 10:28] maybe it was just luck. Thwarted in his initial surprise attack, Constantine decided to follow
[10:28 --> 10:33] up with the opposite approach. He surrounded the city completely and settled in for a good old-fashioned
[10:33 --> 10:42] siege. Thinking fast, Ruricius slipped out of the city before the clampdown was complete and made
[10:42 --> 10:49] his way south to collect a relief force. The idea would be to bring this force up, make Constantine
[10:49 --> 10:54] break away from the siege to face them, and allow the army inside Verona to come pouring out,
[10:54 --> 11:01] trapping Constantine between the two armies and hopefully destroying him. But as the relief army
[11:01 --> 11:06] neared the city, Ruricius discovered that Constantine was refusing to break off the siege,
[11:06 --> 11:11] and instead had sent what appeared to be only a token resistance force to halt his march.
[11:11 --> 11:19] Okay, so much the better then. Now we get to trap him right against the city walls. That'll work
[11:19 --> 11:26] too. And here's where God shows his hand again. Or maybe just where Constantine's soldiers show
[11:26 --> 11:32] that they are just flat out better again. Or maybe more luck. Constantine's defense force
[11:32 --> 11:38] met Ruricius's much larger relief army and after a hotly contested fight, utterly routed them.
[11:38 --> 11:46] Ruricius himself was killed in the battle. The soldiers left inside Verona, now leaderless and
[11:46 --> 11:51] demoralized, decided there was no use resisting anymore and opened the gates to the seemingly
[11:51 --> 11:57] invincible Constantine. In short order, envoys from all the major northern Italian cities,
[11:57 --> 12:03] including Aquileia and Ravenna, arrived in Constantine's camp to announce their surrender.
[12:03 --> 12:12] Yes, things were going just fine for Constantine. But he still had one major obstacle to overcome,
[12:12 --> 12:21] and this was the obstacle that had broken first Severus and then Galerius, Rome itself. The walls
[12:21 --> 12:26] of the city had not gotten any shorter or any thinner since those two previous emperors had
[12:26 --> 12:32] made their attempt, nor was the city any less garrisoned or any less provisioned. A siege
[12:32 --> 12:37] seemed hopeless and there was no way on God's green earth that Maxentius was going to come out
[12:37 --> 12:43] and offer battle. Not when he could sit tight inside the city and wait for Constantine to give
[12:43 --> 12:51] up. So what exactly is the plan here? I guess march on Rome and see what happens next?
[12:51 --> 12:59] Well aware that Constantine was now on his way, Maxentius ordered all the bridges spanning the
[12:59 --> 13:05] Tiber demolished, which would not necessarily stop Constantine's advance, but it would slow
[13:05 --> 13:13] him down. Except that Constantine was in no hurry. Knowing he was in full control of northern Italy,
[13:13 --> 13:19] he marched south at a snail's pace, letting each passing day add luster to the aura of
[13:19 --> 13:26] inevitability he was now bathed in. As summer gave way to fall, the residents of every city,
[13:26 --> 13:32] town, and farm Constantine passed cheered him and wished him well and hailed him as emperor.
[13:32 --> 13:38] With the anticipation now killing them, the citizens of Rome grew restless and
[13:38 --> 13:43] demonstrations began to break out, culminating with a pro-Constantinian chant at a set of
[13:43 --> 13:51] chariot races Maxentius was overseeing. This all had the intended effect and Maxentius began to
[13:51 --> 13:57] seriously worry about his ability to hold out against a siege. The citizens had been with him
[13:57 --> 14:03] when he fought Severus and Galerius, but right now the city looked like it was ready to welcome
[14:03 --> 14:10] Constantine with open arms. Plus, behind closed doors, it was well known that the city was not,
[14:10 --> 14:16] in fact, as well supplied as it had been before, as the years of estrangement with Africa had taken
[14:16 --> 14:23] their toll on the imperial stockpiles as much as they had the free grain dole. All of this led
[14:23 --> 14:28] Maxentius to contemplate a course of action that no one thought he would take in a million years,
[14:28 --> 14:34] because, I mean, it would take a miracle to get him out from behind the Aurelian walls.
[14:34 --> 14:42] With Constantine finally parked just beyond the ruined Milvian Bridge on the north side of the
[14:42 --> 14:49] Tiber in late October 312 AD, Maxentius consulted with his soothsayers to take the pulse of the
[14:49 --> 14:55] gods so he could figure out what he should do. As it turned out, the morning he went to talk to them
[14:55 --> 15:01] was the morning of October 28, which just so happened to be the sixth anniversary of his reign.
[15:01 --> 15:07] These sorts of anniversaries were considered particularly auspicious, and the soothsayers
[15:07 --> 15:12] then confirmed with other readings that the enemies of Rome would be defeated on that very
[15:12 --> 15:20] day. Maxentius needed no further prompting. He ordered his army out of the gates and into
[15:20 --> 15:25] the field. He was going to take the fight to Constantine and settle this once and for all.
[15:25 --> 15:33] But, of course, as we learned last week on the night of October 27, Constantine had made his
[15:33 --> 15:38] own supernatural connection, and now believed completely that he was fighting with the full
[15:38 --> 15:46] blessing of the one true God. With the magical Cairo leading the way, either posted atop a standard
[15:46 --> 15:53] or painted on the shields of his men, his army was truly invincible. That Maxentius was now
[15:53 --> 15:59] suddenly and inexplicably marching out of Rome to face them? Well, is that not a miracle of God?
[15:59 --> 16:06] Yes, the enemies of Rome would be defeated on that day, but the soothsayers never did
[16:06 --> 16:15] say who those enemies of Rome were, now did they? So, as you may have picked up already,
[16:15 --> 16:22] the Battle of the Milvian Bridge is a bit of a misnomer. After all, prior to Constantine's
[16:22 --> 16:27] arrival, Maxentius had ordered all the bridges across the Tiber destroyed, and that included
[16:27 --> 16:33] the Milvian Bridge. So, when Maxentius's army finished the short march from the Flaminian Gate
[16:33 --> 16:38] to the spot on the Tiber where the bridge had stood, he had to build a pontoon bridge of rafts
[16:38 --> 16:45] to get his men to the other side. So, I think the battle should technically be called the Battle of
[16:45 --> 16:51] the Spot near the spot where the Milvian Bridge had been, but where there was now a temporary
[16:51 --> 16:58] pontoon bridge. But that doesn't really roll off the tongue, so Battle of the Milvian Bridge it is.
[16:58 --> 17:05] Though Maxentius nullified his greatest advantage when he decided to come out from behind the
[17:05 --> 17:11] Aurelian Walls, when he took the field on the morning of October 28, he still had every reason
[17:11 --> 17:18] to be confident, as by all accounts, he outnumbered Constantine something like two to one. He arrayed
[17:18 --> 17:23] his army in a long line with its back to the river, long enough that hopefully they would be
[17:23 --> 17:29] able to envelop Constantine's smaller army. But not unlike the Greeks at Marathon, Constantine
[17:29 --> 17:35] decided to risk going to battle with too thin a line, and extended his own to match the length
[17:35 --> 17:42] of Maxentius's to prevent an easy flanking move. The two armies thus lined up, Constantine took the
[17:42 --> 17:49] initiative, and ordered his cavalry to attack Maxentius's horsemen. In short order, Maxentius's
[17:49 --> 17:55] less able cavalry was broken up, and Constantine ordered his infantry to advance. The fight that
[17:55 --> 18:02] ensued was a bitter one, but short, because it appears that Constantine simply took the field
[18:02 --> 18:11] with more talented soldiers, and so Maxentius's army began to be pushed back. Here now, Maxentius's
[18:11 --> 18:18] decisive blunder was revealed to all. He had lined up his army so close to the river, that when
[18:18 --> 18:23] they needed to fall back and regroup, they really had nowhere to go, and things quickly got out of
[18:23 --> 18:31] hand. Hoping to live to fight another day, Maxentius ordered a retreat back to Rome. After all, the
[18:31 --> 18:37] Aurelian walls haven't gone anywhere, but I can still hold out against the siege. But the order
[18:37 --> 18:43] to retreat sparked panic, as way too many men tried to cross way too rickety upon Toon Bridge
[18:43 --> 18:50] to get back to the safe side of the Tiber. Black Tantius reports that as Maxentius himself tried
[18:50 --> 18:55] to cross the river, he was pushed aside by fleeing soldiers and knocked into the Tiber where he
[18:55 --> 19:02] drowned. He was 34 years old, and had been emperor, but never really been emperor for exactly six
[19:02 --> 19:11] years. Constantine spent the rest of the day mopping things up, but on October the 29th he
[19:11 --> 19:17] entered Rome as a conquering hero. He staged an Adventus, which was something like a low-grade
[19:17 --> 19:24] triumph, and paraded his way through the streets to the cheers of the masses. When he arrived in
[19:24 --> 19:30] the Forum though, he pointedly did not climb up the Capitoline Hill and make a sacrifice at the
[19:30 --> 19:36] Temple of Jupiter, as would have been standard operating procedure. A clear sign, at least in
[19:36 --> 19:44] retrospect, that the times they were a-changing. But despite his now increasingly revolutionary
[19:44 --> 19:50] religious posture, Constantine was not ready to upend every apple cart he could get his hands on.
[19:50 --> 19:56] Not yet anyway. So at the end of his parade, he went to the Curia to meet with the Senate and
[19:56 --> 20:03] make nice. They had every reason to fear for their lives and property, but Constantine again
[20:03 --> 20:08] cast himself as the merciful conqueror, and announced that there would be no retribution
[20:08 --> 20:15] against Maxentius' supporters. On top of that, he told them that all those ancient privileges they
[20:15 --> 20:21] had been pining for would be returned to them now that he was in charge. This was all greeted with
[20:21 --> 20:28] enthusiastic applause, and they proclaimed him as the greatest Augustus. In effect, pronouncing him
[20:28 --> 20:34] the senior member of the Tetrarchy. Something that Maximinus Dio would certainly have something to
[20:34 --> 20:43] say about. But Constantine did have a little bit of housekeeping to attend to. He declared
[20:43 --> 20:49] Maxentius' memory to be damned, and all his laws and edicts nullified. All the inscriptions on all
[20:49 --> 20:55] the buildings Maxentius had erected were scratched out, and replaced by inscriptions dedicated to
[20:55 --> 21:02] Constantine. This, for example, is how the Basilica of Maxentius, which wasn't yet completed, came to
[21:02 --> 21:09] be known as the Basilica of Constantine. Turning to a more grisly business, Constantine ordered
[21:09 --> 21:15] Maxentius' body dragged out of the Tiber and beheaded. The head was then paraded through the
[21:15 --> 21:21] city as a warning to everyone of what happens to the enemies of Constantine. Then it was put in a
[21:21 --> 21:28] box and sent to North Africa, so that the locals there would understand completely that Constantine
[21:28 --> 21:35] was now in charge, and that it was best not to mess with him. Finally, Constantine officially
[21:35 --> 21:40] brought an end to the institution that had been so instrumental in shaping the course of Roman
[21:40 --> 21:49] history. 300 years after being formally organized, the Praetorian Guard was abolished for good. The
[21:49 --> 21:54] remaining guardsmen, that is, those who had not died fighting for Maxentius, were reassigned to
[21:54 --> 22:00] posts all over the empire, and their camp, the site of so many pivotal events over the centuries,
[22:00 --> 22:05] was demolished. It was nothing less than the end of an era.
[22:05 --> 22:15] So, as I said at the beginning, in all of this, there is nothing of the legendary triumph of
[22:15 --> 22:20] Christianity over paganism that is usually associated with Constantine's victory at the
[22:20 --> 22:28] Milvian Bridge. All of that would come later, after Constantine was firmly entrenched in power. For
[22:28 --> 22:33] now, the theme of Constantine's victory was simply that he had freed Rome from the tyrant
[22:33 --> 22:40] Maxentius. An exaggerated caricature of Maxentius was drawn up, painting him as a vile and illegal
[22:40 --> 22:47] dictator, but the overt Christian themes would not be played up until later. That said, however,
[22:47 --> 22:53] it cannot be denied that at this point, at a minimum, Constantine was hugely sympathetic
[22:53 --> 22:59] to the Christian cause. The Edict of Milan, which we will talk about next week, for example,
[22:59 --> 23:05] will be issued just months after his victory at the Milvian Bridge, showing that Constantine
[23:05 --> 23:10] was not just sympathetic, but that he was ready to act on that sympathy at the first opportunity.
[23:10 --> 23:15] At the other end of the spectrum, it can plausibly be claimed that at this point,
[23:15 --> 23:21] Constantine was already a true believer, but one who understood that sudden proclamations
[23:21 --> 23:26] of his own Christianity might do more harm to the cause than good, as it would alienate a pagan
[23:26 --> 23:33] population ready to be sympathetic and tolerant, but not yet ready to convert, or perhaps more
[23:33 --> 23:39] importantly, have their emperor convert. His snubbing of the Capitoline Jupiter is telling,
[23:39 --> 23:45] as is the statue he had erected in the Forum, which showed him triumphantly holding the
[23:45 --> 23:51] Lebarum, which was understood by Constantine to be a Christian symbol of power. These actions hint
[23:51 --> 23:55] that there was something more than vague monotheism at work behind the curtain,
[23:55 --> 23:59] but also that he was not yet ready to reveal his whole hand.
[23:59 --> 24:09] Next week, after heading to Milan to cement the alliance between Constantine and Lichinus,
[24:09 --> 24:15] and discuss the aforementioned Edict of Milan, we will head east to see how Maximinist Daya is
[24:15 --> 24:22] handling all of this, and I can assure you, he is not happy about any of it. Isolated in the east,
[24:22 --> 24:27] it will be make or break time for the man who was supposed to be the senior member of the Imperial
[24:27 --> 24:34] College, but who was no longer recognized as such by his brother emperors. Unfortunately for Maximinist,
[24:34 --> 24:39] though, despite his best efforts, it will turn out to be break time, and in less than a year,
[24:39 --> 24:46] what had once been rule by four will be down to rule by two, with Constantine in charge of the
[24:46 --> 24:52] west and Lichinus the east. I wonder how long that is going to last.

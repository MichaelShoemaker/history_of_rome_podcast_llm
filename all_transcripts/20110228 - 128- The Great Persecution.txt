[00:00 --> 00:16] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 128, The Great Persecution.
[00:16 --> 00:21] As we've seen over the course of the past few episodes, the first 15 years of Diocletian's
[00:21 --> 00:25] reign represented a sea change for the Roman Empire.
[00:25 --> 00:30] Some of the reforms he initiated were embraced as long overdue, while others were fought
[00:30 --> 00:32] tooth and nail every step of the way.
[00:32 --> 00:38] For example, the uprisings in Egypt triggered by the crackdown on tax evaders.
[00:38 --> 00:42] Some of his reforms did not outlast his reign, while others became the entrenched status
[00:42 --> 00:48] quo for a thousand years or more, while others, like the price edict, never even got off the
[00:48 --> 00:50] ground.
[00:50 --> 00:54] But all in all, there is no question that Diocletian had taken an empire that was adrift
[00:54 --> 00:57] and placed it back on solid ground.
[00:57 --> 01:02] And impressively, he had done all this with a minimum of ill-advised screw-ups.
[01:02 --> 01:08] That is, Diocletian sometimes pursued policies that were disruptive, and sometimes he pursued
[01:08 --> 01:13] policies that wound up producing no tangible benefits, but he almost never pursued policies
[01:13 --> 01:15] that were both at the same time.
[01:15 --> 01:20] I think it's fair to say that this week we will see him pursue a policy that was both
[01:20 --> 01:22] in spades.
[01:22 --> 01:27] And ironically, for all that Diocletian did right, it was this thing he did wrong that
[01:27 --> 01:33] wound up changing the world more than anything else.
[01:33 --> 01:39] The trouble started in 299 AD, not long after Galerius returned to Antioch in triumph, having
[01:39 --> 01:42] just defeated the Sassanids.
[01:42 --> 01:45] Diocletian and Galerius were together in the imperial residence, and decided to have some
[01:45 --> 01:51] divinations taken to find out what the future looked like from a metaphysical point of view.
[01:51 --> 01:56] But every time the priest reached in to inspect the entrails of a sacrificial animal, he announced
[01:56 --> 01:58] that something had gone wrong.
[01:58 --> 02:02] Something was preventing him from getting a proper reading.
[02:02 --> 02:06] After enduring attempt after attempt, it was finally brought to Diocletian's attention
[02:06 --> 02:11] that certain members of the household's staff were Christian, and that they had been seen
[02:11 --> 02:17] making the sign of the cross to ward off evil demons, aka the gods Diocletian was trying
[02:17 --> 02:19] to contact.
[02:19 --> 02:25] In other words, these Christians were intentionally sabotaging the emperor's divinations.
[02:25 --> 02:30] Diocletian was furious, and immediately ordered all members of his household to make a sacrifice
[02:30 --> 02:33] to the gods, and if they refused, they were to be fired.
[02:33 --> 02:39] Then, egged on by Galerius and a few other staunchly anti-Christian advisors, he extended
[02:39 --> 02:42] his order to the army.
[02:42 --> 02:46] Every officer and soldier in the legions was to make a sacrifice.
[02:46 --> 02:51] The battle meant immediate discharge.
[02:51 --> 02:56] Diocletian was at heart a deeply conservative man who was trying to restore the glory of
[02:56 --> 02:58] the Roman Empire.
[02:58 --> 03:03] His desire to connect imperial authority to Jupiter and the other Olympian gods was, for
[03:03 --> 03:07] him, not necessarily just cynical propaganda.
[03:07 --> 03:12] He very much wanted to get Rome back on the side of the gods who had made the empire great,
[03:12 --> 03:17] and he spent lavishly on temples and sacrifices and memorials throughout the provinces to
[03:17 --> 03:19] help make that happen.
[03:19 --> 03:26] Now, following the reasoning of Decius, Diocletian began to suspect that the continued existence
[03:26 --> 03:32] of the anti-social, impious, and sacrilegious Christians was doing serious damage to the
[03:32 --> 03:35] relationship between Rome and her gods.
[03:35 --> 03:40] So, he began to suspect that it was time for them to go.
[03:40 --> 03:46] But he was also at heart a deeply pragmatic man, and wide-scale religious purges can
[03:46 --> 03:50] rarely be filed under P for pragmatic.
[03:50 --> 03:55] So with his religious conservatism coming into conflict with his political pragmatism,
[03:55 --> 04:01] Diocletian turned to his advisors for, well, advice.
[04:01 --> 04:06] With Galerius taking the lead, they came back to him with the nearly unanimous conclusion
[04:06 --> 04:11] that in this case, his religious instincts must take precedence.
[04:11 --> 04:18] Christianity needed to be stamped out once and for all.
[04:18 --> 04:22] We have, up until this point, only dealt with the Christians in passing, usually as they
[04:22 --> 04:27] intersected with imperial affairs, like when Nero blamed them for the great fire, or when
[04:27 --> 04:31] Pliny asked Trajan what to do about them.
[04:31 --> 04:36] But since Christianity is about to become one of the core defining elements of the Roman
[04:36 --> 04:41] Empire, I think I should probably take this moment to give a brief thumbnail sketch of
[04:41 --> 04:46] the first 300 years of the Church so we can get a feel for what it is exactly Diocletian
[04:46 --> 04:51] is about to try to stamp out, and what it is exactly that in just a few years will become
[04:51 --> 04:56] the most powerful non-imperial institution in the Empire.
[04:56 --> 05:01] Now, by way of disclaimer, I'd like to say that I am not a Church historian, and am not
[05:01 --> 05:06] going to delve deeply into the myriad little controversies about, say, who wrote what
[05:06 --> 05:10] Gospels, when, why, and how.
[05:10 --> 05:15] I just want to give a general overview of how Christianity developed, where it developed,
[05:15 --> 05:20] and what it developed into over the course of its first three centuries.
[05:20 --> 05:25] I am afraid that at times my vocabulary will be imprecise, but I hope that no one will
[05:25 --> 05:31] find too much to argue with in the broad strokes.
[05:31 --> 05:35] So as I'm sure you are no doubt aware, it is said that around 30 A.D., a Jewish holy
[05:35 --> 05:42] man from Nazareth named Jesus was put to death by Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea.
[05:42 --> 05:47] Over the course of his brief career as a preacher, three years being the longest estimate I've
[05:47 --> 05:52] seen, Jesus had won over a small band of adherents known as the disciples, and had earned fame
[05:52 --> 05:57] throughout Galilee for his non-traditional interpretations of Jewish scripture and his
[05:57 --> 06:00] potential for miracle working.
[06:00 --> 06:05] He eventually ran afoul of the Jewish religious authorities, and when he arrived in Jerusalem
[06:05 --> 06:09] for Passover, the exact year is unknown, he was arrested by Roman authorities either
[06:09 --> 06:12] on sacrilegious or revolutionary grounds.
[06:12 --> 06:17] He was found guilty of whatever crime he was charged with and crucified a few days later,
[06:17 --> 06:24] which most people no doubt figured was the end of the ministry of Jesus.
[06:24 --> 06:28] But the disciples of Jesus were not ready to abandon their leader's message.
[06:28 --> 06:33] They continued to meet and worship as he had instructed them to do, and continued to
[06:33 --> 06:37] convert their fellow Jews to their way of life.
[06:37 --> 06:42] The early church was focused on Jesus' role as the prophesied Jewish messiah, and that
[06:42 --> 06:47] per his teachings, he would soon return from the dead to oversee an apocalypse that would
[06:47 --> 06:51] pave the way for the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth.
[06:51 --> 06:55] The early Christians expected this second coming at any moment, and lived their lives
[06:55 --> 06:57] accordingly.
[06:57 --> 07:01] But as the years passed and Jesus did not return, the imminency of the second coming
[07:01 --> 07:07] was emphasized less, and other, more immediate concerns began to demand the attention of
[07:07 --> 07:12] the Christian leadership.
[07:12 --> 07:17] The first major concern for the growing church was the question of the Gentiles, that is,
[07:17 --> 07:18] non-Israelites.
[07:18 --> 07:23] Initially, Christianity was an exclusively Jewish sect.
[07:23 --> 07:25] Every Christian was a practicing Jew.
[07:25 --> 07:29] They just happened to believe in a few extra things that were not believed by mainstream
[07:29 --> 07:31] Judaism.
[07:31 --> 07:35] But as the first generation of disciples went out into the wider Greco-Roman world, they
[07:35 --> 07:39] often found willing non-Jewish adherents.
[07:39 --> 07:42] So are they allowed to be Christian, or what?
[07:42 --> 07:46] Some Christian leaders said yes, and others said no.
[07:46 --> 07:50] As you probably already know, though, the drive to allow for Gentile conversion was
[07:50 --> 07:55] driven by St. Paul, and his point of view eventually won out.
[07:55 --> 08:00] Traditionally, the first Gentile Christian was a centurion named Cornelius, who was baptized
[08:00 --> 08:06] by St. Peter himself, though that is one of those myriad little controversies that I am
[08:06 --> 08:09] not going to wade into.
[08:09 --> 08:14] The question of whether Christianity should retain its strictly Jewish character was answered
[08:14 --> 08:20] early in the negative, but that question was merely the opening salvo in a long-running
[08:20 --> 08:24] Christian debate about the nature of their religion.
[08:24 --> 08:29] That is, whether the Church ought to be composed of a select few who were pure in their faith
[08:29 --> 08:35] and utterly devoted in life, or whether it should make a play at becoming the universal
[08:35 --> 08:40] religion of the world, which would inevitably involve clearing away most of the barriers
[08:40 --> 08:44] to entry into the Church.
[08:44 --> 08:47] At the very beginning, it was understood that you had to be circumcised in order to be a
[08:47 --> 08:53] true Christian, but that barrier was quickly dropped to allow for Gentile adherence.
[08:53 --> 08:55] What other barriers should be dropped?
[08:55 --> 08:58] What barriers could not be dropped?
[08:58 --> 09:03] Though that initial question was resolved, the tension between big-tent and small-tent
[09:03 --> 09:08] Christians would never go away, and every generation some new controversy would flare
[09:08 --> 09:15] up that pitted purists against expansionists.
[09:15 --> 09:20] The second century saw the passing away of the original disciples and gospel writers
[09:20 --> 09:24] and the rise of an independent Christianity with its own hierarchy of command, separate
[09:24 --> 09:29] from all other religions in the empire.
[09:29 --> 09:34] Up until the Great Jewish Revolt, Jerusalem had naturally acted as the de facto capital
[09:34 --> 09:38] of Christianity, since it was, after all, a Jewish sect.
[09:38 --> 09:43] But after Jerusalem fell in 70 AD, the Church began to separate itself permanently from
[09:43 --> 09:48] Judaism, culminating most visibly in the Christian refusal to join in the Third Jewish
[09:48 --> 09:51] War of the 130s AD.
[09:51 --> 09:55] The Romans themselves by that point had already determined the two religions were separate,
[09:55 --> 10:01] and a tax edict issued by Nerva explicitly denies to Christians the special exemptions
[10:01 --> 10:03] enjoyed by the Jews.
[10:03 --> 10:08] See, the Romans liked people to get on board with the Roman way of doing things, and the
[10:08 --> 10:12] Jews had always given them trouble on that front.
[10:12 --> 10:17] But the Romans were also deeply impressed with the sheer ancientness of Judaism, and
[10:17 --> 10:23] so, more or less, let the Jews conform to Roman rule in their own way.
[10:23 --> 10:29] But the Christians were recognized as a newfangled thing, owed no such deference.
[10:29 --> 10:34] Jesus' Church, which had once been just a little sect of Judaism, was now, for better
[10:34 --> 10:40] or for worse, its own independent thing.
[10:40 --> 10:44] The other major consequence of the sack of Jerusalem is that the Christian movement also
[10:44 --> 10:48] became far more decentralized.
[10:48 --> 10:52] With Jerusalem out of the picture, the local leadership of each of the Christian centers
[10:52 --> 10:57] now took command of their parishes and ran them as they saw fit.
[10:57 --> 11:02] Ironically though, just as the Church as a whole was becoming less centralized, the chain
[11:02 --> 11:07] of command at the local level was becoming more centralized.
[11:07 --> 11:11] Over the years, the Christians developed a system whereby each city had its own chain
[11:11 --> 11:17] of authority, with deacons at the lowest rung doing the daily work of tending to the sick
[11:17 --> 11:22] and poor, the next run of presbyters, who would become today's priests, acting as
[11:22 --> 11:27] a sort of governing council, and at the top the bishop, who was the supreme religious
[11:27 --> 11:33] authority in his district, which usually meant that he issued clarifications on the differences
[11:33 --> 11:37] between a true and a false teaching.
[11:37 --> 11:43] Usually the bishops of the largest cities, Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria, came to exert
[11:43 --> 11:49] an extra bit of authority over their surrounding territories, and the bishop of Rome in particular
[11:49 --> 11:53] claimed a higher authority even than that, both because he sat in the capital of the
[11:53 --> 11:59] empire and because his seat had been founded by St. Peter himself.
[11:59 --> 12:05] But if you'd like to enjoy an entertaining conniption fit, just ask the bishop of Alexandria
[12:05 --> 12:11] what he thinks about the primacy of Peter.
[12:11 --> 12:16] Since the main role of the bishop was to establish the difference between what was a true and
[12:16 --> 12:21] what was a false teaching, we must ask the question then, what happened when the bishops
[12:21 --> 12:24] disagreed with each other?
[12:24 --> 12:30] And that, my friends, is the $10,000 question of early Christian history.
[12:30 --> 12:34] The church was not some sort of hive mind, and the various bishops disagreed with each
[12:34 --> 12:40] other frequently, passionately, and sometimes violently about almost everything under the
[12:40 --> 12:42] sun.
[12:42 --> 12:45] And these were serious disagreements.
[12:45 --> 12:49] This was not, I think what that guy over there is teaching is true, and you think what that
[12:49 --> 12:51] guy over there is teaching is false.
[12:51 --> 12:57] It was rather, I think what I am teaching is true, and I think that what you are teaching
[12:57 --> 12:59] is false.
[12:59 --> 13:05] Excommunications and counter-excommunications began to proliferate, and sometimes succession
[13:05 --> 13:10] to a major bishopric began to look like succession to the imperial throne, with supporters of
[13:10 --> 13:15] the new bishop purging supporters of the old bishop, stripping them of their priesthoods
[13:15 --> 13:20] and kicking them out of the church, only to have the whole drama play out in reverse a
[13:20 --> 13:22] few years later.
[13:22 --> 13:27] It is truly a wonder that Christianity managed to maintain any sort of cohesion at all during
[13:27 --> 13:29] this period.
[13:29 --> 13:34] But enough of the bishops had enough of an interest in preventing a major schism that
[13:34 --> 13:39] they would meet in councils, summits really, and hash out their differences, force each
[13:39 --> 13:44] other to compromise, and try to put these controversies to rest.
[13:44 --> 13:48] But just as one issue was put to bed, another would pop up, threatening a split all over
[13:48 --> 13:50] again.
[13:50 --> 13:54] And we haven't even gotten to the really big controversies of the third and fourth centuries
[13:54 --> 13:57] yet.
[13:57 --> 14:02] The third century was as tumultuous for the Christians as it was for everyone else.
[14:02 --> 14:07] Though Christianity had always been an outlaw religion, and had found itself the victim
[14:07 --> 14:13] of periodic local persecutions, in Rome under Nero, in Gaul during the reign of Marcus Aurelius,
[14:13 --> 14:18] and so on, imperial policy rarely took notice of them.
[14:18 --> 14:22] Trajan's advice to Pliny that he ought to ignore the Christians unless they did something
[14:22 --> 14:26] really wrong seemed to be standard operating procedure.
[14:26 --> 14:32] But as the empire fell into chaos, the Christians for the first time felt the sting of coordinated
[14:32 --> 14:35] imperial attack.
[14:35 --> 14:40] Maximinus Thrax ordered the first major attack on Christianity, though he limited the scope
[14:40 --> 14:43] of his persecutions to the bishops.
[14:43 --> 14:47] Fifteen years later, attempting to get Rome back on the right side of the gods, Decius
[14:47 --> 14:52] broadened the scope of persecution to include all Christians, which not only resulted in
[14:52 --> 14:58] confiscations and executions across the empire, but also a major split within the church between
[14:58 --> 15:04] leaders who advocated compliance and those, particularly in North Africa, who advocated
[15:04 --> 15:06] resistance.
[15:06 --> 15:10] The latter would eventually be shouted down and declared heretical when the Decem persecutions
[15:10 --> 15:12] was over.
[15:12 --> 15:18] But this episode foreshadowed the later, larger fight with the Donatists, who advocated similar
[15:18 --> 15:23] resistance to Diocletian's persecutions, or more accurately, resistance to those who
[15:23 --> 15:26] acquiesced to them.
[15:26 --> 15:30] But just as it seemed like things were going from bad to worse for the Christians, the
[15:30 --> 15:37] empire was falling apart, and the emperors were now specifically targeting them for harassment,
[15:37 --> 15:43] and he suddenly enjoyed an unprecedented run of growth and acceptance.
[15:43 --> 15:48] Gallienus canceled the Decem persecution on the grounds that it was unnecessary and unjust,
[15:48 --> 15:53] and the Illyrian emperors had way more important things on their minds.
[15:53 --> 16:00] So from 260 until about 300, the stigma attached to Christianity was muted.
[16:00 --> 16:05] So much so that the religion that had once been derided as a religion of women and slaves
[16:06 --> 16:10] now counted amongst its number wealthy and influential men.
[16:10 --> 16:15] Slaves were now joined by their masters, wives were now joined by their husbands, common
[16:15 --> 16:20] soldiers by their officers, the poor by the rich.
[16:20 --> 16:24] Churches ceased to be little hovels hidden away deep in the maze of an inner city, and
[16:24 --> 16:27] were now being built right out in the open.
[16:27 --> 16:35] By 300 AD, in fact, a church sat on a hill in Nicomedia overlooking the imperial palace.
[16:35 --> 16:39] Christians were still in the minority by a substantial margin across the empire, but
[16:39 --> 16:45] they were estimated by this point to account for about 10% of the population, which was
[16:45 --> 16:49] nothing to sneeze at.
[16:49 --> 16:53] Over the course of the past three centuries, the little sect of heretical Jews led by a
[16:53 --> 16:59] messianic holy man from Nazareth had grown to be the largest monotheistic religion in
[16:59 --> 17:03] the empire, and a social force with real teeth.
[17:03 --> 17:10] Which is, perhaps, what troubled Diocletian's advisors the most.
[17:10 --> 17:15] Of all the myriad differences between Christians and Pagans, perhaps no single difference loomed
[17:15 --> 17:21] larger in the minds of imperial authorities than just how structured Christianity was.
[17:21 --> 17:26] Yes, the church functioned politically more as a loose oligarchy of bishops than as some
[17:26 --> 17:33] unified autocracy, but still, no pagan cult could come close to matching the empire-wide
[17:33 --> 17:38] network of institutionalized authority that Christianity boasted.
[17:38 --> 17:44] It was nothing less than a parallel command structure to the state, and if you listened
[17:44 --> 17:48] to Christian rhetoric for any length of time, you would find that most of them believed
[17:48 --> 17:54] that their command structure actually superseded the state's, render unto Caesar what is Caesar's,
[17:54 --> 17:56] notwithstanding.
[17:56 --> 18:01] The fact that roughly 10% of the population was now Christian and adhered to that command
[18:01 --> 18:05] structure scared the hell out of many in the government.
[18:05 --> 18:11] Plus, that 90-10 split is a bit misleading, because Christianity was still clustered in
[18:11 --> 18:16] the cities at this point, so their minority share seemed that much larger to government
[18:16 --> 18:22] officials living in those same cities.
[18:23 --> 18:27] With genuine fears of organized revolution, there was also the fact that the church was
[18:27 --> 18:32] beginning to raise funds in unprecedented sums, as wealthy patrons began to render unto
[18:32 --> 18:37] God whatever they weren't rendering unto Caesar.
[18:37 --> 18:42] So when we ask the question, why were Diocletian's advisors so keen on taking the Christians
[18:42 --> 18:48] out, the answer essentially boils down to protection of the status quo.
[18:48 --> 18:52] They were amongst the greatest beneficiaries of it, and the Christians were amongst the
[18:52 --> 18:54] greatest threats to it.
[18:54 --> 19:00] So this is all mostly a case of entrenched power making a pre-emptive strike against
[19:00 --> 19:05] a potential rival.
[19:05 --> 19:10] But following the initial purge of the imperial household and the army, tempers cooled some.
[19:10 --> 19:15] The purge of the army was in fact unevenly enforced at best.
[19:15 --> 19:21] And it wasn't until the winter of 302-303 that things really got rolling again.
[19:21 --> 19:25] Not that Diocletian hadn't been gearing up for the fight in the meantime.
[19:25 --> 19:31] In 301 he had visited Egypt and encountered problems with the Manichaeans, a religion
[19:31 --> 19:36] similar to Christianity both in substance and organization, which had become a hotbed
[19:36 --> 19:40] for resistance to imperial authority.
[19:40 --> 19:43] Diocletian was additionally troubled by the Manichaeans because their religion originated
[19:43 --> 19:49] in Persia, and members still had close ties to their brethren in the east, meaning that
[19:49 --> 19:54] they looked to Diocletian a lot like a Sassanid-aligned fifth column.
[19:54 --> 19:57] So the Manichaeans were ruthlessly suppressed.
[19:57 --> 20:03] Executions, exiles, confiscations, and destruction of scripture.
[20:03 --> 20:12] In effect, a dry run for the great persecution of Christians that was coming down the chute.
[20:12 --> 20:17] Diocletian and Galerius were in Nicomedia over the winter of 302-303 when things finally
[20:17 --> 20:19] got going.
[20:19 --> 20:24] The emperors had attempted to get a pronouncement on something or other from an oracle of Apollo,
[20:24 --> 20:29] but the oracle instead announced that the quote, impious on earth, were preventing him
[20:29 --> 20:32] from connecting with the gods.
[20:32 --> 20:38] Diocletian huddled with his council to determine what this meant, and they were of one mind.
[20:38 --> 20:43] It meant that the gods were angry at Rome for tolerating the Christians.
[20:43 --> 20:48] I should mention at this point that it is widely believed that by now Galerius was taking
[20:48 --> 20:54] more of a lead in imperial policy, and as a fierce anti-Christian, that he was actually
[20:54 --> 20:58] the driving force behind all of this.
[20:58 --> 21:04] At its most all-encompassing, the blame Galerius for everything theory contends that the junior
[21:04 --> 21:09] emperor arranged for the botched divination and the non-responsive oracle in order to
[21:09 --> 21:13] push Diocletian into a hard-line stance.
[21:13 --> 21:17] He will also be blamed for the fires that will break out following the publication of
[21:17 --> 21:22] the first anti-Christian edict, which we'll get to in a second.
[21:22 --> 21:27] However, though Galerius proved himself to be a sadist when it came to the Christians,
[21:27 --> 21:32] it is really hard to say in the run-up to the persecution what events he pre-arranged
[21:32 --> 21:38] and what events he simply took advantage of.
[21:38 --> 21:47] On February 23rd, 303 AD, almost exactly 1708 years ago, Diocletian finally let the hard-liners
[21:47 --> 21:48] off the leash.
[21:48 --> 21:53] He ordered the Church of Nicomedia, the one that could be seen from his imperial palace,
[21:53 --> 21:55] razed to the ground.
[21:55 --> 22:00] All of the scripture housed there was burned, and all of its valuables were carted off.
[22:00 --> 22:05] The next day, imperial authorities posted an edict, not only ordering every citizen
[22:05 --> 22:10] in the empire to make a proper pagan sacrifice, but further ordering that every church in
[22:10 --> 22:16] the empire was to be destroyed, all Christian scripture was to be burned, and known Christians
[22:16 --> 22:21] be henceforth forbidden from assembling in one place.
[22:21 --> 22:26] The public outcry was immediate, and the first victim of the persecution was a Christian
[22:26 --> 22:31] man who literally tore the posted edict down off the wall.
[22:31 --> 22:35] Within a week, fires began breaking out in the imperial palace.
[22:35 --> 22:41] According to some sources, these were little Reichstag fires set by Galerius, and Diocletian's
[22:41 --> 22:43] opinion hardened further.
[22:43 --> 22:46] Now the Christian threat was not just theoretical.
[22:46 --> 22:54] They were disobeying imperial orders, and engaging in nothing less than treason.
[22:54 --> 22:58] In the aftermath of this initial uprising, Christians were rounded up and tortured for
[22:58 --> 23:03] information about their brethren, and Galerius seems to have had a particular penchant for
[23:03 --> 23:09] burning victims alive once he was done extracting information from them.
[23:09 --> 23:14] Then, when the first edict was determined to be insufficiently oppressive, a further
[23:14 --> 23:20] law was passed in the summer of 303, ordering that church officials, all those deacons and
[23:20 --> 23:24] presbyters and bishops, be rounded up and jailed.
[23:24 --> 23:29] This of course caused the prisons to overflow, and regular criminals had to be released to
[23:29 --> 23:33] allow for the influx of Christians.
[23:33 --> 23:38] It was around this time that the backlash began.
[23:38 --> 23:42] Hardline anti-Christians, for the most part, only lived in the uppermost rungs of the imperial
[23:42 --> 23:44] government.
[23:44 --> 23:49] Down on the lower levels, soldiers and guards and wardens had a hard time fathoming why
[23:49 --> 23:54] they were being made to suffer under the crushing weight of thousands of harmless old men who
[23:54 --> 23:57] had broken no real laws.
[23:57 --> 24:02] In many cases, these men just outright lied to their superiors, telling them sacrifices
[24:02 --> 24:08] had been dutifully made just so they could clear out the holding cells.
[24:08 --> 24:12] This dynamic played out all over the empire, as the rigor with which the persecution was
[24:12 --> 24:18] pursued became defined by local officials, who, more often than not, wanted no part of
[24:18 --> 24:22] jailing and killing Christians.
[24:22 --> 24:27] In the West especially, the great persecution never really gained traction.
[24:27 --> 24:31] Constantius in particular seems to have set the tone for his territories, and after a
[24:31 --> 24:37] few perfunctory photo ops, he essentially let the whole matter drop, which of course
[24:37 --> 24:42] made him something of a hero within the church, allowing his son to easily play the part of
[24:42 --> 24:47] Christian champion down the road.
[24:47 --> 24:52] In the East though, under the watchful eye of Galerius, Christians in Syria and Egypt
[24:52 --> 24:59] and Asia Minor were rounded up, tortured, and, more often than not, burned alive.
[24:59 --> 25:04] The backlash in the eastern provinces then did not take the form of intentionally blind
[25:04 --> 25:10] state officials, but instead ordinary citizens who were horrified at what the government
[25:10 --> 25:12] was doing.
[25:12 --> 25:17] The victims were their family, their friends, and their neighbors, and even if they were
[25:17 --> 25:23] none of these things, the Christians were by this time widely viewed as a harmless cult
[25:23 --> 25:29] comprised of law-abiding, tax-paying citizens, whose most visible public activity was, what,
[25:29 --> 25:33] tending to the poor and the sick?
[25:33 --> 25:37] On top of that, there was a whole growing community of Romans, like for example the
[25:37 --> 25:43] Emperor Aurelian, who had drifted over to monotheism, even if it was a particularly
[25:43 --> 25:45] pagan brand of it.
[25:45 --> 25:50] They often identified the god of the Christians with their own god, and even if the Christians
[25:50 --> 25:56] did not necessarily reciprocate, monotheists who watched fellow monotheists dragged off
[25:56 --> 25:59] in chains were incensed.
[25:59 --> 26:05] Across the East, citizens hid Christians, lied to protect Christians, helped Christians
[26:05 --> 26:13] escape to the West, and in every way tried to thwart the Imperial agents.
[26:13 --> 26:18] The persecution's initial burst of energy lasted into 304 and would continue on the
[26:18 --> 26:24] books until 311, but it would eventually be dropped by Galerius just prior to his death,
[26:24 --> 26:29] after he finally came to understand that the whole operation had done far more to undermine
[26:29 --> 26:32] Imperial authority than bolster it.
[26:32 --> 26:37] What happened between 304 and 311 to change Galerius' mind, you ask?
[26:37 --> 26:43] How about the rise of Constantine the Great, whose career was in part fueled by citizens,
[26:43 --> 26:49] Christian or otherwise, who viewed the persecution as an unthinkable crime against humanity?
[26:49 --> 26:54] And that is why it appears Diocletian made a huge mistake in aligning himself with the
[26:54 --> 26:56] hardliners.
[26:56 --> 27:01] The persecution disrupted the peace he had spent the last twenty years establishing.
[27:01 --> 27:05] It undermined the legitimacy of the Tetrarchy, paving the way for Constantine to eventually
[27:05 --> 27:12] blow it up, and in return for all that, the persecution had produced for Diocletian no
[27:12 --> 27:14] tangible benefits.
[27:14 --> 27:21] It was a bad policy and a bloody policy, and stands as a giant stain on Diocletian's
[27:21 --> 27:27] otherwise sterling record.
[27:27 --> 27:33] Next week we will get into the only upside for Diocletian, namely that in 305 he would
[27:33 --> 27:39] wash his hands of the whole thing, and in an unprecedented move, announce that he planned
[27:39 --> 27:45] to voluntarily abdicate the throne so he could retire to his villa and, I'm dead serious
[27:45 --> 28:03] about this, raise cabbages.

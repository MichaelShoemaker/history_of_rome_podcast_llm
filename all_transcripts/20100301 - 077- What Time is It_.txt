[00:00 --> 00:13] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 77, What Time Is It?
[00:13 --> 00:17] Domitian's autocratic reign was approaching the decade mark when it finally ran into some
[00:17 --> 00:19] serious blowback.
[00:19 --> 00:24] There had been mumblings and grumblings from day one, but thus far, his loyal bureaucracy
[00:24 --> 00:30] and his loyal troops had forestalled any major attempts at revolution or coup.
[00:30 --> 00:36] But on January 1, 89 AD, exactly 20 years after Vitellius' revolt along the Rhine,
[00:36 --> 00:41] two legions stationed in upper Germany, led by their provincial governor Lucius Antonius
[00:41 --> 00:47] Saturninus, refused to renew their oath to demission, and the Roman world once again
[00:47 --> 00:50] stood on the brink of civil war.
[00:50 --> 00:55] No one had forgotten the horror of 69 AD, and from the outside, Saturninus' revolt
[00:55 --> 00:59] looked eerily similar to the Vitalian rebellion.
[00:59 --> 01:02] Hadn't Kysena led two legions on the upper Rhine in revolt?
[01:02 --> 01:06] And hadn't that spark been carried down the river until the whole of the Rhine legions
[01:06 --> 01:08] stood opposed to the legal emperor in Rome?
[01:08 --> 01:14] And hadn't that led to self-destruction on a scale not seen since the days of Octavian
[01:14 --> 01:15] and Antony?
[01:15 --> 01:20] Yes he had, yes it had, and yes it did.
[01:20 --> 01:24] But this time, things would turn out differently, partly due to the widespread loyalty demission
[01:24 --> 01:29] had earned from the legions, in contrast to the bitter hatred they had directed at Galba,
[01:29 --> 01:33] but also partly due to a heaping shovel full of luck.
[01:33 --> 01:38] Had there not been an early thaw, who knows what would have happened?
[01:38 --> 01:43] Unfortunately, we're never going to know the full story behind Saturninus' rebellion,
[01:43 --> 01:47] but it seems that the governor had been planning his revolt for some time, and had probably
[01:47 --> 01:51] made contact with like-minded senators back in Rome.
[01:51 --> 01:56] We're never going to know, because once the uprising was put down by Lapius Maximus, the
[01:56 --> 02:00] governor of lower Germany who was first on the scene, the victorious governor burned
[02:00 --> 02:05] all of Saturninus' correspondence before demission arrived.
[02:05 --> 02:10] It is likely that the letters implicated all of Saturninus' fellow travelers, and Maximus,
[02:10 --> 02:14] having done his duty and put down the revolt, had no wish for the aftermath to turn into
[02:14 --> 02:17] a bloodbath.
[02:17 --> 02:21] All that we really know is that Saturninus had made some kind of deal with the Chatti,
[02:21 --> 02:26] the same Chatti demission had used as his triumphal prop six years earlier, and the
[02:26 --> 02:31] two legions under Saturninus' direct command were supposed to be reinforced by a strong
[02:31 --> 02:36] Germanic army to help them make their stand against demission.
[02:36 --> 02:41] The emperor responded quickly to the crisis, ordering Maximus to take all action necessary
[02:41 --> 02:45] to quell the revolt, while he himself led a contingent of Praetorians north to deal with
[02:45 --> 02:47] the situation.
[02:47 --> 02:53] To help ensure victory, demission also ordered a legion from Spain to march in on the double.
[02:53 --> 02:58] The legion arrived well after the danger had passed, but the unblinking loyalty of the
[02:58 --> 03:03] legion's commander, a one Mr. Marcus Ulpius Traeanus, earned the commander the gratitude
[03:03 --> 03:08] of demission, who put the man history knows as Trajan on the fast track to his own date
[03:08 --> 03:10] with imperial destiny.
[03:11 --> 03:16] Saturninus' army was on the Roman side of the Rhine, perhaps stuck on perpetual watchtower
[03:16 --> 03:21] duty, which may have helped spurn the restless governor, and his plan was for the Chatti to
[03:21 --> 03:26] cross the frozen Rhine before the rest of the Roman world had a chance to react.
[03:26 --> 03:30] But the luck of the Flavians returned with a vengeance, and in the middle of January
[03:30 --> 03:35] an unheard of early thaw turned the stable and thoroughly frozen Rhine river back into
[03:35 --> 03:37] a rushing torrent.
[03:37 --> 03:42] The Chatti were trapped on the far side, and Saturninus was suddenly left to face the full
[03:42 --> 03:46] brunt of imperial reprisal, with only two legions at his back.
[03:46 --> 03:54] Just 24 days after the revolt began, Saturninus and his legions surrendered to Maximus.
[03:54 --> 03:59] As I said, Maximus took the treasonous governor of Upper Germany into custody, and then proceeded
[03:59 --> 04:02] to burn the paper trail that had led to the uprising.
[04:02 --> 04:08] Who knows what friends, relatives, associates, or otherwise Maximus was protecting, but he
[04:08 --> 04:11] certainly did history no favor by destroying all the evidence.
[04:11 --> 04:18] The revolt, then, is left as a known, but not very well understood, crisis.
[04:18 --> 04:22] Saturninus and his officers were executed, and the two rebellious legions were sent to
[04:22 --> 04:24] the front along the Danube.
[04:24 --> 04:29] Maximus was awarded the governorship of Syria, and Trajan was elevated to a consulship in
[04:30 --> 04:35] followed by key appointments to governorships in Moesia and along the Rhine.
[04:35 --> 04:39] I think we all know where his star is headed.
[04:39 --> 04:44] The year after the revolt, Domitian decided to serve a term as consul himself, and as
[04:44 --> 04:50] his colleague, he made the surprising choice of an influential, but quietly so man named
[04:50 --> 04:52] Marcus Coxius Nerva.
[04:52 --> 04:58] Obviously, serving as the consular colleague of an emperor was incredibly prestigious and
[04:58 --> 05:03] not lightly awarded, so scholars have been left to wonder what Nerva did to earn such
[05:03 --> 05:05] an honor.
[05:05 --> 05:09] Some have speculated that he may have had a hand in uncovering Saturninus' plot, buying
[05:09 --> 05:12] the emperor valuable reaction time.
[05:12 --> 05:16] After all, Nerva had been instrumental in uncovering the Pisonian conspiracy against
[05:16 --> 05:21] Nero the generation before, so maybe the old hand had once again put his ear to the ground
[05:21 --> 05:25] and delivered the imperial house from ruin.
[05:25 --> 05:30] This probably relies too much on his role in uncovering the earlier conspiracy in its
[05:30 --> 05:35] attempt to say that the consulship was a reward for uncovering the latter conspiracy, and
[05:35 --> 05:40] really, we may need to look no further than Nerva's uncanny ability to survive regime
[05:40 --> 05:44] change to explain what he was doing at so prominent a position.
[05:44 --> 05:49] It takes a man of rare political skill to survive such turbulent times unharmed.
[05:49 --> 05:53] Is it really so remarkable that he would one day find himself the consular colleague of
[05:53 --> 05:59] an emperor, or that one day he would simply find himself emperor?
[05:59 --> 06:05] Marcus Nerva was born November 8, 30 A.D., into an Italian family that had risen to prominence
[06:05 --> 06:08] as the Principate was taking shape.
[06:08 --> 06:13] His family was not elite Roman nobility, but more and more such distinctions were becoming
[06:13 --> 06:14] irrelevant.
[06:14 --> 06:19] Vespasian's family was not from Rome proper either, and soon enough the empire would see
[06:19 --> 06:24] its first provincial emperor in the aforementioned Trajan.
[06:24 --> 06:28] Nerva's grandfather had been a friend of Tiberius and accompanied the emperor to Comprie, while
[06:28 --> 06:33] his father had risen to the rank of consul under Caligula.
[06:33 --> 06:37] Nerva himself eschewed the conventional curses honorum and seems to have had no interest
[06:37 --> 06:42] in a military career, content instead to wield behind the scenes political influence as an
[06:42 --> 06:47] advisor to the emperor of his own day, Nero.
[06:47 --> 06:51] In this capacity he earned Nero's eternal gratitude for the central role he played in
[06:51 --> 06:57] uncovering the Pisonian conspiracy, and the emperor rewarded him with unprecedented triumphal
[06:57 --> 07:03] regalia, an honor usually reserved for military victories.
[07:03 --> 07:07] While skillfully navigating his way around Nero's imperial court, Nerva at some point
[07:07 --> 07:12] ran into Vespasian and the two struck up a friendship.
[07:12 --> 07:18] When Nero committed suicide, I think any reasonable bookmaker would have put Nerva down as a staunch
[07:18 --> 07:19] Othonian.
[07:19 --> 07:24] Not only was his sister married to Otho's brother, but most of Nero's court wound up
[07:24 --> 07:28] in Otho's corner anyway during the civil wars, and Nerva was certainly a member of
[07:28 --> 07:30] Nero's court.
[07:30 --> 07:35] But Nerva ignored these obvious loyalties and decided early to back Vespasian should
[07:35 --> 07:39] the latter heed the calls to enter the ring.
[07:39 --> 07:43] His friendship and support allowed Nerva to become one of the few members of Nero's inner
[07:43 --> 07:48] circle to transition to the inner circle of the Flavians, which he did so in fine style
[07:48 --> 07:53] by being named a consul ordinarii in 71 AD.
[07:53 --> 07:57] And that's the prestigious one, remember, that Vespasian usually reserved for members
[07:57 --> 07:59] of his own family.
[07:59 --> 08:04] Nerva spent the next two decades attached at the hip to the Flavian court, acting as
[08:04 --> 08:08] a historically undocumented but still powerful member of the regime.
[08:08 --> 08:14] Indeed, after his consulship in 71, he doesn't really pop up again until 90 AD, when he is
[08:14 --> 08:18] suddenly awarded the honor of serving as Domitian's colleague in the consulship.
[08:18 --> 08:24] We'll probably never know what role, if any, Nerva played in uncovering Saturninus' rebellion
[08:24 --> 08:28] or whether it had anything to do with the consular appointment.
[08:28 --> 08:32] It could be that after the failed uprising, Domitian wanted to reassert firm control over
[08:32 --> 08:38] the empire and took as his partner the only man he could trust without reservation.
[08:38 --> 08:43] A man who had served as an advisor and mentor since Domitian's lonely days in Rome after
[08:43 --> 08:49] being left behind when his father and brother went to fight the Jewish war.
[08:49 --> 08:53] After the rebellion, Domitian more than ever needed to surround himself with men he could
[08:53 --> 08:55] trust.
[08:55 --> 09:00] After all, Maximus had taken it upon himself to burn all the evidence in Saturninus' tent
[09:00 --> 09:03] before the emperor and his agents could look at it.
[09:03 --> 09:08] Who knows what names would have popped up as additional conspirators or fellow travelers
[09:08 --> 09:12] or officially neutral but secret nod-winkers.
[09:12 --> 09:17] As is so often the case after failed assassinations or coups or rebellions, Domitian couldn't
[09:17 --> 09:21] help but grow more paranoid and suspicious.
[09:21 --> 09:24] Which members of that senatorial delegation are plotting to kill me?
[09:24 --> 09:29] Which of my provincial governors are secretly building anti-imperial alliances?
[09:29 --> 09:34] How many of my slaves would stab me to death to earn their freedom?
[09:34 --> 09:40] Distrustful by nature, Domitian's paranoia accelerated through the 90s AD.
[09:40 --> 09:43] He was not blind to what was happening to him though, nor was he blind to the public's
[09:43 --> 09:49] perception that their emperor was jumping at more shadows lately and with harsher consequences.
[09:49 --> 09:54] The problem, as Domitian saw it, was not that he was paranoid for no reason, but that he
[09:54 --> 09:59] had every rational right to be paranoid because conspiracies did exist against his life that
[09:59 --> 10:01] needed to be uncovered.
[10:01 --> 10:07] Suetonius reports that Domitian lamented angrily that no one believes in murderous secret plots
[10:07 --> 10:11] against the emperor unless the emperor turns up dead.
[10:11 --> 10:14] Domitian was caught in a trap and he knew it.
[10:14 --> 10:19] Stay vigilant and be accused of paranoid tyranny or lighten up and die.
[10:19 --> 10:24] A prudent survivor, Domitian decided he could live with the former if it meant that he would
[10:24 --> 10:27] live.
[10:27 --> 10:31] After the events of 89 AD then, there was a sharp uptick in treason trials, the old
[10:31 --> 10:37] imperial weapon of last resort that had been abandoned by his father and officially outlawed
[10:37 --> 10:39] by his brother.
[10:39 --> 10:43] It would be neat and clean to say that the revolt caused Domitian to revive the practice,
[10:43 --> 10:47] but over the course of his reign he had already killed a handful of senators for treasonous
[10:47 --> 10:53] activities and his decidedly reactionary take on free speech had dramatically increased
[10:53 --> 10:57] the scope of what would be considered treasonous activities.
[10:57 --> 11:03] This is why we can only say that the 90s AD saw Domitian's paranoia increase rather than
[11:03 --> 11:07] say that the 90s AD is when it began.
[11:07 --> 11:11] In the last five years of his reign though, Domitian killed about 20 men of senatorial
[11:11 --> 11:16] rank and confiscated the property of dozens more.
[11:16 --> 11:20] Banishments and executions came with disturbing regularity and it was during this time that
[11:20 --> 11:26] Domitian's reputation as a bloodthirsty tyrant was really cemented.
[11:26 --> 11:30] To a man the senate feared and loathed him.
[11:30 --> 11:34] Some were afraid of being falsely accused or being deliberately set up by personal enemies
[11:34 --> 11:38] while others were afraid that their very real attempts to overthrow the emperor were going
[11:38 --> 11:41] to be discovered.
[11:41 --> 11:45] Domitian meanwhile was stuck trying to sort through rumors, innuendo and vague shreds
[11:45 --> 11:50] of evidence convinced that every day might be his last if he didn't get to them before
[11:50 --> 11:52] they got to him.
[11:52 --> 11:59] It was simply put a bad time all around for everyone.
[11:59 --> 12:04] In 96 AD Domitian finally struck too close to home and his own court officials turned
[12:04 --> 12:11] against him determining that none of them were safe as long as Domitian remained alive.
[12:11 --> 12:16] Supposedly this last plot was hatched after Domitian executed one of Nero's old freedmen
[12:16 --> 12:21] who had once upon a time helped Nero escape the palace and then helped the outlaw emperor
[12:21 --> 12:24] commit suicide.
[12:24 --> 12:28] Citing the crime of not doing enough to protect his former master, Domitian had the freedman
[12:28 --> 12:33] killed even though the man had been serving as an imperial secretary for years.
[12:33 --> 12:39] The convoluted rationale and cross loyalties in the story cast doubt on how much of this
[12:39 --> 12:41] version of events is true.
[12:41 --> 12:45] Whether or not the man actually returned to imperial service for example or really whether
[12:45 --> 12:47] Domitian had him killed at all.
[12:47 --> 12:52] But his alleged death is cited by Suetonius as the catalyst for Domitian's chamberlain
[12:52 --> 12:58] Parthenius to organize an assassination in 96 AD.
[12:58 --> 13:03] Most of who knew what remains pure speculation but the three men we know for sure that were
[13:03 --> 13:09] in on the plot were Parthenius himself, his freedman Maximus, and an attendant to one
[13:09 --> 13:13] of Domitian's nieces named Stephanus.
[13:13 --> 13:17] Maximus was to be the inside man in the palace making sure that the right doors were locked
[13:17 --> 13:22] and the right doors were unlocked and making sure that on the day of the deed the sword
[13:22 --> 13:26] Domitian kept under his bed would be removed.
[13:26 --> 13:30] Stephanus was to be the actual assassination and in preparation for his attack he faked
[13:30 --> 13:36] an arm injury so everyone would get used to seeing him around with his arm in a sling.
[13:36 --> 13:40] With his presence in the palace never suspicious as he was in the direct employ of the imperial
[13:40 --> 13:46] family and his injured arm now old news to the Praetorians watching over the emperor,
[13:46 --> 13:52] Stephanus was able to then hide a dagger in the bandages and come and go as he pleased.
[13:52 --> 13:58] The legend then goes that Domitian had long been particularly agitated around noontime
[13:58 --> 14:02] as an astrologer had once told him that that was the time of day that he was destined to
[14:02 --> 14:04] die.
[14:04 --> 14:08] So he was in the habit of constantly asking what time it was until the hour of his demise
[14:08 --> 14:13] passed so he could relax and go about his business without the fear of death hanging
[14:13 --> 14:15] over his head.
[14:15 --> 14:20] But on September 18 one of his servants who was in on the plot lied to the emperor and
[14:20 --> 14:26] told him it was well past noon when it was in fact just reaching that hour.
[14:26 --> 14:30] Intent that he was going to live at least one more day Domitian let down his guard and
[14:30 --> 14:35] retired to his personal quarters to sign some paperwork.
[14:35 --> 14:39] When Stephanus arrived and demanded an audience with the emperor claiming that he had uncovered
[14:39 --> 14:44] a plot against the emperor's life, Domitian let the boy in to hear what he had to say.
[14:44 --> 14:49] Unaware that the plot Stephanus was about to reveal was, you know, the one he was planning
[14:49 --> 14:52] to execute right then and there.
[14:52 --> 14:56] Once he was close enough to the emperor, Stephanus pulled the dagger out of his sling
[14:56 --> 14:59] and stabbed Domitian in the groin.
[14:59 --> 15:04] But Domitian was not going to be an easy kill and having survived the initial attack he
[15:04 --> 15:08] managed to fend Stephanus off for several minutes before further accomplices rushed
[15:08 --> 15:11] in and overwhelmed the wounded emperor.
[15:11 --> 15:16] Suetonius reports that at least four other men helped Stephanus inflict seven fatal
[15:16 --> 15:22] stab wounds on Domitian, who finally collapsed on the floor, dead at the age of 45.
[15:22 --> 15:27] The conspirators then hauled the body off and had it cremated without ceremony.
[15:27 --> 15:32] The only concession the dead emperor was afforded was that his ashes were eventually deposited
[15:32 --> 15:38] in the Flavian temple rather than simply being scattered to the four winds.
[15:38 --> 15:43] He had ruled the empire for fifteen dictatorial but more or less successful years and would
[15:43 --> 15:47] be remembered as a monster.
[15:47 --> 15:52] Questions have long abounded about who else was in on the final plan to kill Domitian.
[15:52 --> 15:58] Cassius Dio implicates his wife Domitila and others have accused the Praetorians of purposeful
[15:58 --> 16:02] apathy if not outright complicity.
[16:02 --> 16:07] Further, the Senate's sudden announcement the next day that Nerva, man of the political
[16:07 --> 16:12] shadows, was their unanimous choice to serve as the next emperor has raised more than a
[16:12 --> 16:17] few ancient and modern eyebrows about his involvement in the plot.
[16:17 --> 16:23] I think we can safely say that in their conduct both before and after the assassination that
[16:23 --> 16:28] Domitila and the rank-and-file Praetorians probably knew nothing of the plot.
[16:28 --> 16:34] However, one of the Praetorian prefects, Titus Petronius Secundus, was probably aware of
[16:34 --> 16:38] what was unfolding and did nothing to prevent it.
[16:38 --> 16:42] But it also seemed that he did nothing to bring any of the guardsmen under his command
[16:42 --> 16:45] into his confidence.
[16:45 --> 16:50] Nerva's involvement is far cloudier as he shied away from the public eye.
[16:50 --> 16:55] He was well connected enough to have eyes and ears everywhere, so it seems reasonable
[16:55 --> 16:57] that he may have known something.
[16:57 --> 17:01] And the speed with which he was confirmed as heir to the throne suggests that someone
[17:01 --> 17:06] may have approached him directly about whether he would be willing to dawn the purple.
[17:06 --> 17:11] But his years of loyalty not just to the Flavians, but to the imperial house in general, seemed
[17:11 --> 17:14] to belie such suspicions.
[17:14 --> 17:18] But then again, he did let all the conspirators go without so much as a slap on the wrist,
[17:18 --> 17:21] so who knows?
[17:21 --> 17:27] With Nerva in place, the Senate then let fifteen years of simmering anger explode in a series
[17:27 --> 17:31] of edicts officially damning Domitian's memory.
[17:31 --> 17:35] His name was taken off all the public monuments and buildings he had constructed over the
[17:35 --> 17:41] years, and statues or reliefs that bore his likeness were re-carved to look like Nerva.
[17:41 --> 17:46] The goal was to pretend as if Domitian never happened, just as Augustus had once tried
[17:46 --> 17:50] to pretend that Mark Antony had never happened.
[17:50 --> 17:55] But the law banishing Domitian from the collective memory worked no better than it had for Augustus,
[17:55 --> 18:01] and even in Rome itself, it was difficult to keep everyone on the same revisionist page.
[18:02 --> 18:07] Without in the province, it was an utter impossibility, and in the legions, it was downright dangerous
[18:07 --> 18:09] to even suggest it.
[18:09 --> 18:13] The rank and file still loved Domitian, and they screamed for blood when his murder was
[18:13 --> 18:15] announced.
[18:15 --> 18:19] When the assassins were let go, they howled for vengeance, and for the entirety of his
[18:19 --> 18:24] brief reign, Nerva would have difficulty exerting any kind of real influence on the troops for
[18:24 --> 18:27] having allowed such a betrayal.
[18:27 --> 18:32] Next week, things will get so bad for Nerva that the Praetorians will actually besiege
[18:32 --> 18:37] the palace and take him hostage, demanding, among other things, the literal heads of Domitian's
[18:37 --> 18:41] assassins.
[18:41 --> 18:46] As I've said a few times, Domitian wanted to usher in nothing less than an Augustan
[18:46 --> 18:51] renaissance, and during his time in office, he certainly matched the breadth and depth
[18:51 --> 18:54] of the first emperor's interests.
[18:54 --> 18:59] Just as with Augustus, Domitian did not limit himself to war and politics.
[18:59 --> 19:04] To both of them, the influence of the princeps rightly extended into all aspects of Roman
[19:04 --> 19:11] life, the economy, culture, the arts, morality, and sexuality.
[19:11 --> 19:15] Domitian attempted to follow the blueprint laid down by Augustus.
[19:15 --> 19:18] After all, it had worked out great the first time around.
[19:18 --> 19:24] But unfortunately, he never did have the personal gravitas to pull it off.
[19:24 --> 19:28] Millions of all stripes had scoffed when Augustus tried to implement his conservative
[19:28 --> 19:29] morality laws.
[19:29 --> 19:35] The reception when Domitian tried to revive them was a healthy belly laugh.
[19:35 --> 19:39] When Augustus put his foot down after the disaster in the Tudiburg and declared an end
[19:39 --> 19:44] to Roman expansion and a reorganization of the legions into a defensive force, his commanders
[19:44 --> 19:45] obeyed.
[19:45 --> 19:50] Augustus's military credentials were, after all, impeccable.
[19:50 --> 19:54] But when the more or less civilian Domitian hewed the identical line, he was accused of
[19:54 --> 19:58] cowardice, dereliction of duty, and worse.
[19:58 --> 20:03] He had done nothing to earn the respect of his officers, and generals openly vented their
[20:03 --> 20:04] frustrations.
[20:04 --> 20:10] Even though, had the order come from Augustus, they would have hopped too without question.
[20:10 --> 20:15] Augustus was able to do much because he was Augustus, and Domitian's difficulties stand
[20:15 --> 20:20] as living proof of the first emperor's unique talents.
[20:20 --> 20:24] Domitian forever battled on, but his Augustan renaissance was doomed to failure, as long
[20:24 --> 20:30] as Augustus himself was not around to make it work.
[20:30 --> 20:34] Next week, we'll begin the smooth transition from the Flavian dynasty to the so-called
[20:34 --> 20:40] Nervan Antonine dynasty, which will control Rome until the assassination of Commodus nearly
[20:40 --> 20:43] a century hence.
[20:43 --> 20:49] This new dynasty will be populated by the men Gibbon famously dubbed the Five Good Emperors,
[20:49 --> 20:54] and during their time on the throne, the empire will reach its peak culturally, economically,
[20:54 --> 20:57] and geographically.
[20:57 --> 21:01] In addition to their own unique talents, the Five Good Emperors are collectively remembered
[21:01 --> 21:05] for the wisdom they showed in picking their successors.
[21:05 --> 21:10] Rather than relying on their own possibly deficient biological sons, they chose to adopt
[21:10 --> 21:14] men of merit who would rule the empire as well as they had.
[21:14 --> 21:19] The example they set in this regard is often lauded as basically the pinnacle of enlightened
[21:19 --> 21:24] politics and noble sacrifice in the name of civic virtue.
[21:24 --> 21:29] The only problem with this is that until Marcus Aurelius, none of the emperors of the Nervan
[21:29 --> 21:35] Antonine dynasty actually had biological sons to pass power onto.
[21:35 --> 21:40] Nerva had to adopt Trajan, who had to adopt Hadrian, who had to adopt Antonius Pius, who
[21:40 --> 21:46] had to adopt Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, because between them there was not a biological
[21:46 --> 21:48] son to be found.
[21:48 --> 21:53] So while it was a remarkable run of capable men, and they all deserve credit for their
[21:53 --> 21:57] eventual choices and heirs, we should not pretend that they were purposely refusing
[21:57 --> 22:01] to hand power to their biological heirs.
[22:01 --> 22:06] The first chance one of them had to pass the throne onto a son took it, and that decision
[22:06 --> 22:11] is where Gibbon finally landed in his search for the beginning of the end of the Roman
[22:11 --> 22:14] Empire.
[22:14 --> 22:18] The last thing I'll mention before I go is that I recently recorded a short interview
[22:18 --> 22:23] about the history of Rome for BBC5 Radio's Pods and Blogs series that should be airing
[22:23 --> 22:25] this Tuesday night.
[22:25 --> 22:31] If you're interested, I've posted a link to the interview at thehistoryofrome.typepad.com,
[22:31 --> 22:36] but you can also get the episode on iTunes by searching for Pods and Blogs.
[22:36 --> 22:40] I will note, however, that I haven't actually heard the final cut of the interview, so if
[22:40 --> 22:44] it turns out that I sound like a damn fool, then I'm going to erase the link and deny
[22:44 --> 22:46] the whole thing ever happened.

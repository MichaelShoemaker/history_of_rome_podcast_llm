[00:03 --> 00:07] Hello, and welcome to the history of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:13] The Romans licked their wounds, or perhaps more accurately, nursed their egos after
[00:13 --> 00:16] the defeat at Codine Forks in 321 BC.
[00:17 --> 00:22] Five years passed with the Romans engaging their neighbors in minor skirmishes, but
[00:22 --> 00:25] avoiding another major confrontation with the Samnites.
[00:25 --> 00:29] Whether this was because of an official peace treaty, or out of Roman fear, is
[00:29 --> 00:33] still unclear, but whatever the cause, there was a break in the fighting.
[00:34 --> 00:39] All that changed in 316 BC, however, when the Romans, confident once again,
[00:39 --> 00:42] marched out and attempted again to conquer the Samnites.
[00:43 --> 00:45] This second stage of the war started out no better for
[00:45 --> 00:48] the Romans than the first had ended, though.
[00:48 --> 00:51] But they soon gained the upper hand, and after ten years of hard fighting,
[00:51 --> 00:55] the Romans would force the Samnites to submit in 304 BC.
[00:57 --> 01:00] In the race to victory, the Romans stumbled out of the gates.
[01:00 --> 01:04] In 315 BC, they met the Samnites near Laudelais and
[01:04 --> 01:06] were defeated in convincing fashion.
[01:07 --> 01:09] Details of the battle are sketchy, but
[01:09 --> 01:12] it appears certain that the dictator commanding the Roman legion was
[01:12 --> 01:13] killed in the fighting.
[01:14 --> 01:17] Rome's power was now on the verge of completely unraveling.
[01:17 --> 01:21] They had lost a major battle at Codine without a fight, and
[01:21 --> 01:24] now, on their big comeback tour, when they actually took the field against
[01:24 --> 01:26] the Samnites, they were soundly beaten.
[01:27 --> 01:28] Things were not looking good for the Romans.
[01:29 --> 01:33] Campania, the territory over which Rome and Samnium had originally clashed,
[01:34 --> 01:37] was perilously close to abandoning their treaty with Rome, so
[01:37 --> 01:40] recently entered into and giving themselves over to the Samnites.
[01:41 --> 01:44] Tarentum, a major Greek city in the south, had already declared for
[01:44 --> 01:49] the Samnites, and now negotiations had begun to bring the Etruscans into the fray.
[01:49 --> 01:53] However, the Etruscans bought high on Samnite power, and
[01:53 --> 01:56] when they did enter the war, found themselves overmatched by a newly
[01:56 --> 01:57] resurgent Rome.
[01:58 --> 02:02] It was during these years that the Romans began to radically alter the
[02:02 --> 02:05] legion's organization and tactics, switching from the clunky phalanx
[02:05 --> 02:08] into the maneuverable three-line manable system.
[02:09 --> 02:12] Once the structural deficiencies of their army were ironed out,
[02:13 --> 02:16] Rome's advantage in wealth and manpower left little doubt as to
[02:16 --> 02:17] the final outcome of the war.
[02:19 --> 02:23] One of the ways that wealth manifested itself as an aid to the war effort
[02:23 --> 02:26] was in an infrastructure project that survives today,
[02:26 --> 02:31] a living monument to Roman engineering genius, the Via Appia, or Appian Way.
[02:32 --> 02:35] During the first Samnite war, though they emerged victorious,
[02:36 --> 02:39] the Romans struggled constantly to move troops and supplies south into
[02:39 --> 02:43] Campania and Samnium in anything resembling quick time.
[02:43 --> 02:48] Wet, marshy land separated the two points, literally bogging down efforts.
[02:48 --> 02:51] Roads through the foothills above were too hazardous, and
[02:51 --> 02:55] the only other route was a long, arduous trip along the coast.
[02:56 --> 02:59] The Romans needed a way to get into Campania quickly, and
[02:59 --> 03:03] began to entertain the idea of building a straight road linking Rome and
[03:03 --> 03:05] Capua, the capital city of Campania.
[03:06 --> 03:10] The proposals never got off the ground, as resources were tied up first
[03:10 --> 03:12] with the Latin War, then again with the Samnites.
[03:12 --> 03:16] But in 312 BC, a man came forward with the vision and
[03:16 --> 03:18] will to accomplish the goal.
[03:19 --> 03:22] Appius Claudius, whose name was attached to the road for his efforts,
[03:22 --> 03:26] was a member in good standing of one of the more controversial families in Rome,
[03:26 --> 03:27] the Claudei.
[03:28 --> 03:32] Implacable foes of the Publians, the Claudei never lacked for enemies.
[03:33 --> 03:36] Indeed, it had been another Appius Claudius who had headed the Decemvri
[03:36 --> 03:40] in its efforts to consolidate power after compiling the 12 tables of
[03:40 --> 03:42] Locke around 450 BC.
[03:43 --> 03:47] But the Appius Claudius of whom we speak today outdid them all in
[03:47 --> 03:49] pomposity and pretensions to infallibility.
[03:50 --> 03:53] He remains himself one of the more interesting and
[03:53 --> 03:56] infamous figures in Roman history, both the driving force behind some of
[03:56 --> 04:00] the most ambitious public works projects in history, and a man who
[04:00 --> 04:04] seemed coolly untroubled by his own thrashing of constitutional and
[04:04 --> 04:06] religious precedents.
[04:07 --> 04:11] Claudius was elected censor, an office of enormous importance, in
[04:11 --> 04:14] 312 BC, along with a colleague.
[04:15 --> 04:18] One of the critical functions of the censors at this point was to
[04:18 --> 04:21] declare who was eligible for the Senate and who was eligible to vote.
[04:23 --> 04:26] Claudius, rather than simply following the previous year's roles,
[04:26 --> 04:30] as was the custom, decided to drastically alter the composition of
[04:30 --> 04:33] the Senate and the electorate, expelling members he considered his
[04:33 --> 04:36] enemies, and enrolling men who promised him loyalty.
[04:37 --> 04:41] Aghast, his colleague resigned, knowing that if he did so,
[04:41 --> 04:45] Claudius would be stopped because any time one censor died or
[04:45 --> 04:48] resigned, the others stepped down so two fresh censors could stand in
[04:48 --> 04:49] their place.
[04:50 --> 04:54] But Claudius refused to step down, sparking a minor constitutional crisis.
[04:55 --> 04:58] The manipulated Senate, however, made of senators who owed their
[04:58 --> 05:01] office to Claudius, predictably remained silent.
[05:02 --> 05:05] Despite calls for his head, Claudius remained in office.
[05:06 --> 05:10] He then further infuriated public opinion by taking certain sacred
[05:10 --> 05:13] rights away from a family he disapproved of and passing them into
[05:13 --> 05:15] the hands of public slaves.
[05:16 --> 05:20] For this offense, Claudius was allegedly struck blind by the gods,
[05:21 --> 05:24] though accounts of his eyesight loss do not crop up until later in
[05:24 --> 05:28] the annals, and then seemed to only describe his final days as old
[05:28 --> 05:32] blind Claudius, declaring Rome's determined opposition to Pyrrhus' invasion.
[05:34 --> 05:38] In any event, blind or not, Claudius set to work on his pet projects,
[05:38 --> 05:42] two of which stood foremost in his mind, the road to Capua,
[05:43 --> 05:46] which would bear his name, and a series of aqueducts that would guarantee
[05:46 --> 05:50] a fresh water supply for Rome, which would also bear his name.
[05:51 --> 05:54] The Romans had finally accepted Claudius as single censor and
[05:54 --> 05:57] even applauded his lead in the public works.
[05:57 --> 06:02] But he set off a fresh firestorm when his term of office expired after 18 months.
[06:02 --> 06:06] He shocked everyone by declaring that he would not be stepping down.
[06:06 --> 06:08] Rome was aghast at this sacrilege.
[06:09 --> 06:11] He had sworn an oath to step down and
[06:11 --> 06:14] now flouted it with all the hubris of a Greek tragic hero.
[06:15 --> 06:19] In the end, Claudius would remain censor for five unprecedented years,
[06:20 --> 06:24] generally upsetting constitutional purists, but endearing himself to the people
[06:24 --> 06:28] with his liberal dispensations from the treasury, the obvious benefits of his
[06:28 --> 06:32] projects, and his policies of enfranchisement, for
[06:32 --> 06:35] he extended the vote to landless citizens who otherwise had no voice at all.
[06:36 --> 06:39] He proved sufficiently popular that when he stepped down,
[06:40 --> 06:42] he immediately won election as consul.
[06:43 --> 06:47] In later years, the scandals of Appius Claudius were largely forgotten, and
[06:47 --> 06:50] he was remembered first and foremost as the man who gave the Romans their most
[06:50 --> 06:53] important road and their most important network of aqueducts.
[06:55 --> 06:58] The Appian Way, after it had served its immediate military purpose,
[06:59 --> 07:02] would evolve into the main artery of travel and trade for the Romans,
[07:02 --> 07:06] eventually stretching over 500 miles southeast across the peninsula.
[07:08 --> 07:12] Equipped with their new road, made of stone, bowed to prevent water collection,
[07:13 --> 07:16] and supported by retaining walls, the Romans were now able to keep their
[07:16 --> 07:20] troops in Samnium, far better supplied than before, and
[07:20 --> 07:22] the war began to slowly turn against the Samnites.
[07:24 --> 07:26] The Roman strategy was straightforward,
[07:27 --> 07:29] though it took years to see it through to the end.
[07:29 --> 07:32] The Samnites, unlike their neighbors in the lowlands,
[07:32 --> 07:35] did not concentrate in large cities, and as a result,
[07:36 --> 07:39] there was no one place the Romans could target to bring a swift conclusion to
[07:39 --> 07:40] hostilities.
[07:41 --> 07:45] They had to proceed piecemeal, cutting off Samnite communities from each other
[07:45 --> 07:49] by holding the mountain passes and building fortresses along navigable rivers.
[07:50 --> 07:55] Once an area was secure, the Romans could move on, at all times doing
[07:55 --> 07:59] their best to cut off supply routes and access to summer or winter pasture land,
[08:00 --> 08:02] and so disrupt the entire Samnite way of life.
[08:03 --> 08:07] In this way, the Romans slowly hemmed in the Samnites and annexed more and
[08:07 --> 08:10] more of their territory, sending in colonists and
[08:10 --> 08:13] taking possession of Samnium bit by little bit.
[08:14 --> 08:18] The Samnites, however, were not the only enemy the Romans now faced.
[08:18 --> 08:21] The Etruscans, mustering what solidarity they could,
[08:21 --> 08:26] rose up in arms in 311 BC and opened a whole new theater of operations.
[08:28 --> 08:32] Each year, the Romans designated one of their consuls to handle operations in
[08:32 --> 08:34] Samnium, while the other went north to Atruria.
[08:35 --> 08:38] It speaks volumes of the manpower and wealth available to Rome,
[08:39 --> 08:42] that they were able to run wars on two completely separate fronts and
[08:42 --> 08:44] emerge victorious from both.
[08:46 --> 08:49] The Romans were in the driver's seat for most of the decade,
[08:49 --> 08:53] with the Senate truly gripped by panic only once, in 310 BC.
[08:53 --> 08:56] And even then, it was a panic from a lack of information,
[08:56 --> 08:58] rather than from any true danger.
[08:59 --> 09:04] In the north, the consul in charge, former insubordinate master of horse,
[09:04 --> 09:07] Quintus Fabius, went off the radar for a while.
[09:08 --> 09:11] He had defeated an Etruscan army, and the survivors had fled into
[09:11 --> 09:14] the Comenian forest, a dense, roadless,
[09:14 --> 09:17] wooded area which was off limits to the superstitious Romans.
[09:18 --> 09:23] But Fabius decided reports about rodents of unusual side lurking in the forest
[09:23 --> 09:27] were overblown and took his army in, pursuing the fleeing Etruscan army.
[09:29 --> 09:32] He was out of contact for some time, which would have been a cause for
[09:32 --> 09:37] concern, but not alarm, had not his colleague in Samnium been wounded
[09:37 --> 09:38] in battle at the same time.
[09:39 --> 09:43] The Senate, back in Rome, received word that one consul was injured,
[09:43 --> 09:47] who knew how badly, and the other had led his army into the nightmare
[09:47 --> 09:50] woods of the Comenian forest, and began to panic.
[09:51 --> 09:54] In point of fact though, the consul in Samnium recovered from his
[09:54 --> 09:58] minor injuries quickly, and Quintus Fabius was actually in the process
[09:58 --> 10:02] of securing an alliance with the people who dwelled inside the Comenian.
[10:02 --> 10:04] But the Senate knew none of this.
[10:05 --> 10:09] Papyrus Cursor, the man who had ordered the execution of young Fabius,
[10:09 --> 10:14] was appointed dictator by the panicky Senate and led an army of fresh recruits
[10:14 --> 10:17] into Atruria to track down the lost legions.
[10:17 --> 10:20] When he arrived, Fabius had already emerged from the woods,
[10:21 --> 10:22] new allies in tow.
[10:22 --> 10:25] He was surprised and horrified to find that his command had been given
[10:25 --> 10:29] to Papyrus, whom he understandably bore some resentment
[10:29 --> 10:31] over the drama a few years earlier.
[10:31 --> 10:35] But he submitted to the Senate's will and allowed Papyrus to take command.
[10:36 --> 10:40] Together they led their combined army against the regrouped Etruscans
[10:40 --> 10:41] near Lake Vadimo.
[10:42 --> 10:45] The resulting battle was the only clash with the Etruscans
[10:45 --> 10:46] that was ever in doubt.
[10:47 --> 10:50] All three Roman lines became involved, and the tide did not turn
[10:50 --> 10:51] until late in the day.
[10:52 --> 10:55] The Etruscans, however, eventually broke and fled.
[10:55 --> 10:58] They never again caused the Romans serious trouble, surrendering
[10:58 --> 11:02] in 308 BC, leaving the Samnites to carry on alone.
[11:03 --> 11:05] The Samnites were now in desperate straits.
[11:06 --> 11:08] They were having difficulty with their supply lines.
[11:08 --> 11:10] Their armies could not link up with one another.
[11:11 --> 11:14] They were constantly outnumbered, and their communities were beginning
[11:14 --> 11:18] to suffer terribly under what was, in essence, a massive siege,
[11:18 --> 11:20] not of a city, but of an entire territory.
[11:22 --> 11:25] The Samnites held on as long as they could, but finally,
[11:25 --> 11:29] reluctantly, sued for peace in 304 BC, bringing an end
[11:29 --> 11:30] to the Second Samnite War.
[11:31 --> 11:33] They had lost a great deal of their territory,
[11:34 --> 11:37] and the Romans had founded 13 colonies in and around Samnium.
[11:38 --> 11:40] In the north, the Romans had pushed deep
[11:40 --> 11:44] into Etruscan territory, and either controlled by arms
[11:44 --> 11:47] or alliance, most of what had once been the most powerful
[11:47 --> 11:48] confederation in Italy.
[11:49 --> 11:51] Roman garrisons settled in across the peninsula,
[11:52 --> 11:54] leaving only the Greek-controlled south untouched
[11:54 --> 11:55] by Roman power.
[11:57 --> 11:59] The Second Samnite War had been an incredibly
[11:59 --> 12:01] transformative period of time.
[12:02 --> 12:04] Italy had gone from being a land of fractured
[12:04 --> 12:07] and competing sovereigns, to a land under the control
[12:07 --> 12:08] of a single dominant power.
[12:10 --> 12:13] Roman citizenship was extended in its various gradient forms
[12:13 --> 12:17] to tribes across the peninsula, who recognized more and more
[12:17 --> 12:19] that their future prosperity would be determined
[12:19 --> 12:21] by their relationship with Rome.
[12:22 --> 12:24] And though the Romans were, of course, resisted,
[12:24 --> 12:27] and at this point, their domination was by no means
[12:27 --> 12:30] complete, as many as fought simply acquiesced
[12:30 --> 12:32] and welcomed the Romans with open arms.
[12:33 --> 12:36] As I noted previously, the Romans treated those
[12:36 --> 12:38] who submitted without a fight with amazing generosity,
[12:39 --> 12:41] giving them full access to Roman prosperity.
[12:42 --> 12:45] Though they gave up their sovereignty and were required
[12:45 --> 12:47] to submit soldiers for the legions,
[12:47 --> 12:49] they received their fair share of the spoils
[12:49 --> 12:52] and were allowed, as was standard Roman practice,
[12:52 --> 12:55] a great deal of latitude in their own local rule.
[12:56 --> 12:59] The Romans themselves also changed.
[12:59 --> 13:02] Obviously, the makeup of the legions was now radically
[13:02 --> 13:04] different than it had been, with its strategy, tactics,
[13:05 --> 13:06] and organization completely overhauled.
[13:07 --> 13:10] But the completion of the Appian Way and the aqueducts,
[13:10 --> 13:13] so impressive in their scope and so well conceived
[13:13 --> 13:15] in their construction, that it signaled a change
[13:15 --> 13:17] in the Romans as a whole, as they began
[13:17 --> 13:20] to outpace their contemporaries in terms
[13:20 --> 13:21] of their level of civilization.
[13:22 --> 13:25] Rome, in short, was becoming the Rome we think of
[13:25 --> 13:30] and remember today, the Rome that keeps us fascinated 1,500
[13:30 --> 13:32] years after the fall of their empire.
[13:34 --> 13:36] The Samnites, however, were not done yet.
[13:37 --> 13:39] After 10 years of peace, they realized that any treaty
[13:39 --> 13:41] with Rome meant effectively an end
[13:41 --> 13:43] to their independence forever.
[13:44 --> 13:46] Rome was moving inexorably in the direction
[13:46 --> 13:49] of imperial master, not simply powerful neighbor.
[13:49 --> 13:53] In a last desperate play for general Italian independence,
[13:54 --> 13:56] the Samnites organized and led a coalition
[13:56 --> 13:58] that included the Etruscans, the Umbrians,
[13:59 --> 14:01] and even the Gauls against Roman power.
[14:02 --> 14:05] Next week, we will cover the resulting conflict,
[14:05 --> 14:06] known as the Third Samnite War,
[14:07 --> 14:09] though the name is a bit of a misnomer.
[14:09 --> 14:12] It was not simply Rome against the Samnites,
[14:12 --> 14:14] but Rome against everyone.
[14:15 --> 14:16] And in this war against everyone,
[14:16 --> 14:20] Rome would win and everyone else would lose.

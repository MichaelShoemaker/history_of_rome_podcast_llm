[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 49, Apollo and Dionysus.
[00:13 --> 00:18] Last time, Antony and Octavian, but really Antony, defeated the combined armies of Brutus
[00:18 --> 00:21] and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi in late 42 BC.
[00:22 --> 00:26] Just two years removed from the assassination of Julius Caesar, an assassination that
[00:26 --> 00:28] was supposed to herald the return of the Republic.
[00:28 --> 00:33] The Romans were as far removed from democracy as they had been under the Tarquans.
[00:33 --> 00:39] Power now resided fully in the hands of just three men, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus.
[00:39 --> 00:42] Their word was law, no debate, and no appeal.
[00:43 --> 00:47] But of course, it was not the final ambition of any one of the three to rule with colleagues.
[00:48 --> 00:50] They all aimed to hold the prize for themselves.
[00:51 --> 00:55] For now, the Triple Alliance held because their triumph was too fresh not to be threatened
[00:55 --> 01:00] on all sides by men who, having submitted, now waited for any opportunity to throw off
[01:00 --> 01:01] the Triumvirate yoke.
[01:02 --> 01:06] But even understanding their precarious position, the dynamic within the Triumvirate
[01:06 --> 01:07] began to change.
[01:08 --> 01:11] Lepidus, who had been left in charge of Italy while the other two Triumvirs
[01:11 --> 01:15] went east, was about to find himself the odd man out in what had always been
[01:15 --> 01:18] a struggle between Octavian and Antony.
[01:19 --> 01:23] After Philippi, the balance of power that would define the next few years of
[01:23 --> 01:27] alliance and rivalry between the two lead Triumvirs began to shake out.
[01:28 --> 01:31] Mark Antony stayed in the east with eight legions, while Octavian took the remaining
[01:31 --> 01:36] troops, old Caesarian veterans, and surrendered liberator soldiers alike back to Italy.
[01:37 --> 01:41] The two Triumvirs had signed an agreement granting Antony power over the empire east
[01:41 --> 01:46] of the Adriatic and Octavian the west, excepting Greater Gaul, which remained in
[01:46 --> 01:46] Antony's hands.
[01:47 --> 01:51] Each would focus on their sphere of influence to solidify power for the Triumvirate.
[01:52 --> 01:54] Antony obviously had the more glamorous position.
[01:55 --> 01:59] It had long been a Roman ambition to invade Parthia and move the empire into the
[01:59 --> 02:00] eastern interior.
[02:00 --> 02:04] It was now up to Antony to pick up the baton dropped first by Crassus and then
[02:04 --> 02:07] by Julius Caesar and carry it across the finish line.
[02:08 --> 02:12] Octavian, meanwhile, was left with the unenviable task of demobilizing tens of
[02:12 --> 02:17] thousands of veterans, finding them lands to settle on in an overcrowded continent
[02:17 --> 02:20] without any money left in the treasury to purchase the necessary land.
[02:21 --> 02:25] While Antony went off to play conquering hero, Octavian was left to play
[02:25 --> 02:29] bureaucratic dunce, caught between angry veterans and angry citizens.
[02:30 --> 02:33] Plus, the one real internal threat to the Triumvirate remaining after
[02:33 --> 02:36] Philippi was left Octavian to deal with.
[02:37 --> 02:41] Sextus Pompey, the now 25 year old son of Pompey the Great, had gathered
[02:41 --> 02:43] a pirate fleet and taken control of Sicily.
[02:44 --> 02:48] For Antony, it was all eastern queens never ending banquets and planning for
[02:48 --> 02:48] greatness.
[02:48 --> 02:54] For Octavian, it was grain shortages, general strikes, and angry mobs.
[02:55 --> 02:59] The main problem facing the Triumvirate, which was fast becoming a
[02:59 --> 03:02] biumvirate, especially now that the rich province of Spain had been taken
[03:02 --> 03:06] away from Lepidus and given to Octavian, was that the state coffers
[03:06 --> 03:06] were empty.
[03:07 --> 03:10] No thought had been spared for the future when the Triumvirate built
[03:10 --> 03:14] their war machine to face Brutus and Cassius, but having won now, they
[03:14 --> 03:16] were faced with the consequences of victory.
[03:16 --> 03:20] In particular, promises of land had been made to the soldiers to entice
[03:20 --> 03:23] them into the army in the first place and then keep them there through
[03:23 --> 03:24] the hard times.
[03:25 --> 03:27] Now the bill was coming due.
[03:27 --> 03:31] In the past, as with Pompey's veterans or Julius Caesar's
[03:31 --> 03:34] veterans, the riches won in battle were used to purchase property
[03:34 --> 03:35] for the retiring soldiers.
[03:36 --> 03:39] Though there was no enshrined eminent domain protection that
[03:39 --> 03:42] required the state to pay a fair price for seized land, it was
[03:42 --> 03:43] simply practical to do so.
[03:44 --> 03:47] It kept hurt feelings to a minimum and left everyone, soldier and
[03:47 --> 03:49] citizen alike, relatively happy.
[03:50 --> 03:53] But Octavian and Antony had not conquered foreign lands and
[03:53 --> 03:56] returned home seated atop a massive pile of cash.
[03:57 --> 04:00] They had barely emerged from a bitter civil war that had left
[04:00 --> 04:03] them very, very poor rather than very, very rich.
[04:05 --> 04:07] Back in Rome, Octavian faced a choice.
[04:07 --> 04:11] Reneg on the promise to the some 40,000 soldiers scheduled for
[04:12 --> 04:14] simply take by force the land needed to keep his word.
[04:15 --> 04:18] It should come as no surprise to anyone that in this new world
[04:18 --> 04:21] order where soldiers were the principal currency of politics,
[04:21 --> 04:23] that Octavian chose the latter.
[04:24 --> 04:27] He marked down sites across Italy to settle the veterans and
[04:27 --> 04:29] arbitrarily confiscated the necessary land.
[04:30 --> 04:33] Some of the seizures came from large senatorial estates that
[04:33 --> 04:34] could absorb the loss.
[04:34 --> 04:37] But just as often, the settlement swallowed entire
[04:37 --> 04:38] free holdings.
[04:38 --> 04:41] Families whose only crime was living where Octavian's finger
[04:41 --> 04:43] landed on a map were thrown off their land.
[04:44 --> 04:47] The public was outraged and as the dispossessed streamed
[04:47 --> 04:49] into Rome, where else could they go?
[04:49 --> 04:52] Riots broke out between ex-soldiers and
[04:52 --> 04:53] evicted citizens.
[04:54 --> 04:56] Octavian realized he could only push the civilian
[04:56 --> 04:59] population so far before they would come after him with
[04:59 --> 05:00] pitchforks.
[05:00 --> 05:02] And so he called a halt to the confiscations.
[05:03 --> 05:06] But unfortunately, what had been seized already was not
[05:06 --> 05:08] enough to satisfy all the veteran claims.
[05:08 --> 05:11] So now, rather than facing angry mobs of citizens,
[05:12 --> 05:14] Octavian faced angry mobs of ex-soldiers.
[05:15 --> 05:18] On top of everything else, Sextus Pompey, having taken
[05:18 --> 05:20] control of Sicily with a fleet that far outgunned
[05:20 --> 05:23] anything the Triumvirs could muster at this point, began
[05:23 --> 05:26] a blockade of Italy that left the all-important grain
[05:26 --> 05:27] supply lines broken.
[05:28 --> 05:31] Octavian, in a word, was miserable.
[05:32 --> 05:35] By contrast, out in the eastern provinces, Mark
[05:35 --> 05:38] Antony had styled himself as the new incarnation of
[05:38 --> 05:41] Dionysus and was doing his best to live up to the
[05:41 --> 05:44] ecstatic lifestyle that defined the Greek god of wine
[05:44 --> 05:44] and abundance.
[05:45 --> 05:48] He indulged endlessly in everything the provinces had
[05:48 --> 05:48] to offer.
[05:49 --> 05:51] And going far beyond what would be considered good
[05:51 --> 05:54] taste back in Rome, the new Dionysus actively joined
[05:54 --> 05:57] in the rituals of the Eastern mystery cults.
[05:57 --> 06:00] Antony traveled slowly from Greece into Asia Minor
[06:00 --> 06:02] and settled in Cilicia on the southern coast.
[06:03 --> 06:05] From this base of operations, he planned to raise money
[06:05 --> 06:08] and men for his invasion of Parthia.
[06:08 --> 06:10] But having already bled the provinces dry during the
[06:10 --> 06:13] years of civil war, there was little left that Rome
[06:13 --> 06:14] could squeeze out of the natives.
[06:15 --> 06:17] Realizing increased taxes weren't getting him
[06:17 --> 06:20] anywhere fast, Antony's gaze naturally turned south
[06:20 --> 06:22] across the sea to the rich lands of Egypt.
[06:24 --> 06:26] Conveniently, now fully in control of her country,
[06:27 --> 06:29] Cleopatra had styled herself as the new Isis.
[06:30 --> 06:33] In Egyptian mythology, Isis was the sister and wife
[06:33 --> 06:36] of Osiris, who had long been seen as an Eastern analog
[06:36 --> 06:39] for, wait for it, Dionysus.
[06:39 --> 06:42] The match was too perfect not to embrace completely.
[06:43 --> 06:46] Antony invited Cleopatra to meet with him in Cilicia
[06:46 --> 06:47] and the queen agreed.
[06:47 --> 06:50] The alliance they forged was mutually beneficial.
[06:50 --> 06:52] Antony got the revenue stream he needed for his
[06:52 --> 06:55] further adventures and Cleopatra got a new Roman
[06:55 --> 06:58] patron to protect her position in Egypt.
[06:59 --> 07:02] Julius Caesar had been the personal guarantor of her
[07:02 --> 07:04] rule and with him dead, she needed a powerful ally
[07:04 --> 07:06] in Rome to maintain the throne.
[07:07 --> 07:09] It was a match made in heaven, literally according
[07:09 --> 07:11] to their mutual propaganda campaign.
[07:12 --> 07:14] Antony decided to follow Cleopatra to Alexandria
[07:14 --> 07:15] for the winner.
[07:15 --> 07:17] Beyond the political alliance they cemented,
[07:18 --> 07:19] the withers spent in each other's company
[07:19 --> 07:20] produced twins.
[07:22 --> 07:25] 41 BC arrived chock full of bad news for both
[07:25 --> 07:26] triumphers.
[07:26 --> 07:29] In Italy, Antony's brother Lucius, who was consul
[07:29 --> 07:32] for the year, conspired with Antony's wife Fulvia
[07:32 --> 07:34] to foment a rebellion against Octavian.
[07:35 --> 07:37] Just how in the loop Mark Antony was remains unclear.
[07:38 --> 07:40] Of course he claimed he knew nothing about it,
[07:40 --> 07:42] but that was after the fact, after the rebellion
[07:42 --> 07:43] failed spectacularly.
[07:43 --> 07:45] Certainly he took no active part in the
[07:45 --> 07:48] machinations, he had other things to worry about.
[07:48 --> 07:50] While aware that the Romans were planning an invasion,
[07:51 --> 07:53] the Parthians had launched a preemptive strike
[07:53 --> 07:53] into Syria.
[07:54 --> 07:56] Antony quickly abandoned his love nest in Alexandria
[07:56 --> 07:59] and returned to military life.
[08:01 --> 08:03] The protracted, if ultimately minor uprising
[08:03 --> 08:06] in Italy against Octavian was hatched by Fulvia
[08:06 --> 08:09] and Lucius Antony once the breadth of Octavian's
[08:09 --> 08:10] political troubles became apparent.
[08:11 --> 08:13] The young man was struggling mightily with
[08:13 --> 08:15] the thorny issues that come when there was
[08:15 --> 08:17] too little land and too little grain,
[08:17 --> 08:19] and he was traveling fast down a road of
[08:19 --> 08:21] pleasing none of the people, none of the time.
[08:22 --> 08:25] To top things off, his aristocratic pampered
[08:25 --> 08:27] upbringing had left him with something
[08:27 --> 08:28] of a tin ear politically.
[08:29 --> 08:31] In the midst of a grain shortage caused by
[08:31 --> 08:33] Sextus Pompey's blockade for example,
[08:34 --> 08:36] Octavian attended a lavish banquet where each
[08:36 --> 08:38] guest came dressed as a different Greek god.
[08:39 --> 08:41] In contrast to Antony's embrace of the
[08:41 --> 08:43] indulgent and emotional Dionysus,
[08:43 --> 08:45] Octavian came dressed as Apollo,
[08:45 --> 08:47] god of light and rationality.
[08:48 --> 08:50] Octavian meant only to have a bit of fun
[08:50 --> 08:53] and begin the process of associating himself
[08:53 --> 08:54] publicly with the divine Apollo,
[08:55 --> 08:58] but instead the public was outraged that while
[08:58 --> 09:01] they starved, self-styled gods were eating all the food.
[09:01 --> 09:03] If public opinion polls had existed,
[09:04 --> 09:05] Octavian's numbers would have been in the toilet.
[09:07 --> 09:09] So Fulvia and Lucius Antony stirred up
[09:09 --> 09:10] resentment amongst the struggling veterans
[09:10 --> 09:12] while simultaneously picking up the cause
[09:12 --> 09:15] of the dispossessed and now starving ex-freeholders.
[09:16 --> 09:17] They managed to raise some legions
[09:17 --> 09:20] of disgruntled citizens and sent word around
[09:20 --> 09:22] to the standing armies loyal to Antony
[09:22 --> 09:24] that this was all being done with his approval.
[09:25 --> 09:27] But the Antonian generals were skeptical
[09:27 --> 09:29] and held back from what was clearly
[09:29 --> 09:31] a half-baked scheme to oust Octavian.
[09:32 --> 09:33] They were talking about directly
[09:33 --> 09:35] assaulting the heir of Julius Caesar.
[09:35 --> 09:37] He may be unpopular, but still,
[09:38 --> 09:39] that was not a thing done lightly.
[09:40 --> 09:42] If it was what Antony wanted, so be it,
[09:42 --> 09:44] but let the orders come from him.
[09:44 --> 09:46] Until then, they were staying put.
[09:47 --> 09:49] Octavian sent his friend a grip at a deal
[09:49 --> 09:51] with the floundering rebel army,
[09:51 --> 09:52] which holed up in the fortress town
[09:52 --> 09:54] of Perusia in central Italy.
[09:55 --> 09:57] After a long siege, the town finally fell
[09:57 --> 09:58] to Octavian's forces.
[09:59 --> 10:01] It was a minor victory against a weak opponent,
[10:01 --> 10:03] but it had the effect of giving Octavian
[10:03 --> 10:05] a military victory in his own right
[10:05 --> 10:06] without anyone being able to point
[10:06 --> 10:09] to a more senior officer who really won the battle,
[10:09 --> 10:12] even though Agrippa really won the battle.
[10:13 --> 10:15] It was an important legitimizing moment
[10:15 --> 10:17] for the young statesman who badly needed
[10:17 --> 10:18] a legitimizing moment.
[10:18 --> 10:21] Lucius Antony committed suicide just as Perusia fell,
[10:22 --> 10:23] and Fulvia went into exile.
[10:24 --> 10:26] She died of an illness the next year in Greece
[10:26 --> 10:28] after an emotional confrontation with Antony,
[10:28 --> 10:31] who blamed her for the whole unnecessary fiasco.
[10:31 --> 10:34] In her attempt to exploit Octavian's weakness,
[10:34 --> 10:36] she had left him stronger than ever.
[10:38 --> 10:40] Perhaps smarting from the unexpected betrayal
[10:40 --> 10:42] by the Antony's and also glowing
[10:42 --> 10:45] with renewed confidence, in early 40 BC,
[10:45 --> 10:47] Octavian broke a clear provision
[10:47 --> 10:49] in his agreement with Antony to leave Gaul alone.
[10:50 --> 10:52] The governor of the province,
[10:52 --> 10:54] a staunch Antonian general named Colenus,
[10:54 --> 10:56] suddenly died, and without consulting
[10:56 --> 10:59] his triumvirate partner, Octavian went north
[10:59 --> 11:01] and took command of the 11 legions stationed there.
[11:02 --> 11:04] The move was nothing less than an act of war
[11:04 --> 11:06] so far as Antony was concerned.
[11:07 --> 11:09] Leaving the east in the hands of his capable lieutenants,
[11:09 --> 11:11] Antony immediately headed back to Italy
[11:11 --> 11:12] to confront his young colleague.
[11:13 --> 11:15] With Octavian seemingly intent on breaking
[11:15 --> 11:19] the triumvirate, Antony simultaneously sent out feelers
[11:19 --> 11:21] to Sextus Pompey and Sicily, looking for an alliance.
[11:22 --> 11:24] He found the young Republican amenable
[11:24 --> 11:27] to a joint operation, and Antony signaled
[11:27 --> 11:29] that Sextus should harass the coast of Italy at will
[11:29 --> 11:31] to put pressure on Octavian.
[11:32 --> 11:33] Antony also picked up the support
[11:33 --> 11:36] of the Republican fleet that had once upon a time
[11:36 --> 11:39] blockaded the Adriatic prior to the Battle of Philippi.
[11:39 --> 11:41] In what was shaping up to be the final showdown
[11:41 --> 11:43] between Antony and Octavian,
[11:43 --> 11:46] the old Republicans were clearly casting their lot
[11:46 --> 11:47] with Antony.
[11:49 --> 11:52] In an attempt to blunt the efforts of Antony's diplomacy,
[11:52 --> 11:55] Octavian decided that it was high time he took a wife
[11:55 --> 11:57] and arranged a marriage with the widowed Scribonneum.
[11:58 --> 12:01] She was a much older woman and seemed a poor match
[12:01 --> 12:03] until you consider that she was also
[12:03 --> 12:05] Sextus Pompey's aunt-in-law.
[12:05 --> 12:08] In the highly familial world of Roman politics,
[12:08 --> 12:10] Octavian was signaling his own willingness
[12:10 --> 12:11] to ally with Sextus.
[12:12 --> 12:14] At the very least, he hoped to make the young admiral
[12:14 --> 12:17] think twice before taking sides against his new uncle.
[12:19 --> 12:21] Antony and his fleet arrived in Vrindisium
[12:21 --> 12:23] and found the city locked up tight
[12:23 --> 12:24] by Octavian's garrison.
[12:25 --> 12:28] A siege began and Octavian hurried down
[12:28 --> 12:30] with his armies to assess the situation.
[12:30 --> 12:33] Was this the beginning of the end of the Triumvirate?
[12:34 --> 12:35] In an interesting turn of events,
[12:36 --> 12:38] the answer turned out to be an emphatic no.
[12:40 --> 12:42] Centurions in both camps had had enough of civil war.
[12:43 --> 12:45] They had had enough of killing each other.
[12:45 --> 12:48] They were friends, neighbors, comrades,
[12:48 --> 12:49] in some cases family.
[12:50 --> 12:50] Enough was enough.
[12:51 --> 12:53] You know the old saying, what if they threw a war
[12:53 --> 12:55] and no one showed up?
[12:55 --> 12:57] At Vrindisium, that's exactly what happened.
[12:58 --> 13:00] The Centurions went to their respective commanders
[13:00 --> 13:02] and said, look, you do what you want,
[13:02 --> 13:04] but we're not going to battle.
[13:05 --> 13:07] We would suggest coming to some kind of an agreement
[13:07 --> 13:09] because the only way this is going to end now
[13:09 --> 13:11] if you both refuse to compromise
[13:11 --> 13:14] is some kind of single combat collateral death match
[13:14 --> 13:15] for control of the empire,
[13:16 --> 13:17] which is fine, we'll cheer you on,
[13:18 --> 13:20] but we're not doing your fighting for you anymore.
[13:21 --> 13:22] Left mutually defenseless,
[13:23 --> 13:24] Antony and Octavian decided to deal.
[13:26 --> 13:28] The Triumvirate alliance was reconfirmed
[13:28 --> 13:30] and the east-west power sharing was formalized
[13:30 --> 13:33] with Antony crucially conceding Gaul to Octavian.
[13:34 --> 13:37] Lepidus still hung in there in his official triumvir
[13:37 --> 13:39] and was granted the province of Africa,
[13:39 --> 13:41] but by now he was irrelevant.
[13:41 --> 13:44] The third wheeled triumvir will make one last big play
[13:44 --> 13:46] to get back in the game after the campaign
[13:46 --> 13:48] against Sextus Pompey in Sicily,
[13:48 --> 13:51] but it will only net him a forced retirement.
[13:53 --> 13:55] The treaty was met with relief by the people of Rome
[13:55 --> 13:58] and further celebrated when news came
[13:58 --> 13:59] of the final deal sealer.
[14:00 --> 14:03] Newly widowed Antony would wed Octavian's sister,
[14:03 --> 14:04] Octavia.
[14:04 --> 14:07] The triumvirate was one big happy family again.
[14:07 --> 14:08] They all returned to Rome together
[14:08 --> 14:10] to celebrate the coming nuptials.
[14:12 --> 14:14] Meanwhile, Sextus Pompey,
[14:14 --> 14:16] who had so recently been courted by both triumvirs,
[14:17 --> 14:18] was now out in the political cold again
[14:18 --> 14:20] and returned to his blockade.
[14:21 --> 14:23] But though he was not going to play the part of kingmaker,
[14:24 --> 14:26] his strangulation of the grain supply routes
[14:26 --> 14:27] was taking its toll on Rome
[14:27 --> 14:29] and the triumvirs came under immense pressure
[14:29 --> 14:31] to come to terms with him.
[14:31 --> 14:34] After initially refusing any compromise,
[14:34 --> 14:35] the triumvirate finally bowed
[14:35 --> 14:37] to the ever rising grain prices
[14:37 --> 14:39] and in the summer of 39 BC,
[14:39 --> 14:41] invited Pompey to the bargaining table.
[14:42 --> 14:44] In exchange for lifting the blockade,
[14:44 --> 14:46] the triumvirs offered to legalize his hold
[14:46 --> 14:48] over Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica,
[14:49 --> 14:51] making the young man governor of all three islands.
[14:51 --> 14:53] In addition, they would slate him
[14:53 --> 14:54] for a consulship the next year.
[14:55 --> 14:57] After mowing it over, Sextus agreed.
[14:59 --> 15:00] By legalizing Sextus,
[15:00 --> 15:03] the triumvirs also invited back into the fold
[15:03 --> 15:06] all the Republican exiles who had fled to his banner.
[15:07 --> 15:09] Prescribed families, lucky to get out of Rome alive,
[15:10 --> 15:11] were now allowed to return to their homes.
[15:12 --> 15:14] One young family who took the triumvirate
[15:14 --> 15:16] up on their offer of clemency
[15:16 --> 15:17] was Tiberius Claudius Nero,
[15:18 --> 15:20] his 19-year-old wife Livia Drusilla,
[15:20 --> 15:23] and their infant son, also named Tiberius.
[15:23 --> 15:26] They had been on the run since Tiberius the Elder
[15:26 --> 15:28] had joined and then fled from
[15:28 --> 15:31] Folvia's ill-advised revolt two years before.
[15:32 --> 15:33] Tiberius was something of a doofus
[15:33 --> 15:35] who always managed to find himself
[15:35 --> 15:37] on the wrong side of any given fight,
[15:37 --> 15:38] going back to his stance against
[15:38 --> 15:41] the first triumvirate 15 years earlier.
[15:42 --> 15:44] His only lasting contribution to Roman history
[15:44 --> 15:46] was the fact that he agreed to a divorce
[15:46 --> 15:48] when Octavian announced that he intended to marry Livia,
[15:49 --> 15:51] having fallen madly in love with her at first sight.
[15:52 --> 15:54] The only complication was that both Livia
[15:54 --> 15:56] and Scribonia were pregnant.
[15:57 --> 16:00] Devoid of sentimentality, Octavian divorced Scribonia
[16:00 --> 16:03] on the day she gave birth to his only biological child,
[16:03 --> 16:06] a daughter named Julia, in October 39 BC.
[16:07 --> 16:09] He and Livia were wed three days after
[16:09 --> 16:11] she gave birth to her second son, Drusus.
[16:12 --> 16:14] With these marital ties lined up,
[16:14 --> 16:16] the Julio-Claudian dynasty
[16:16 --> 16:18] that we have all come to know and love
[16:18 --> 16:19] finally fell into place.
[16:20 --> 16:22] The infant Tiberius would, in time,
[16:22 --> 16:25] be adopted by Augustus and then inherit the throne,
[16:25 --> 16:27] becoming Rome's second emperor.
[16:27 --> 16:30] His brother, Drusus, was the father of Claudius,
[16:30 --> 16:33] grandfather of Caligula, and great-grandfather of Nero.
[16:34 --> 16:35] Germanicus is in there, too,
[16:35 --> 16:37] but we'll get to all of that.
[16:38 --> 16:40] Almost immediately after securing the treaty
[16:40 --> 16:41] with the triumvirate,
[16:42 --> 16:44] Sexis realized that he had made a terrible deal.
[16:44 --> 16:46] He was already in control of Sicily,
[16:46 --> 16:48] Corsica, and Sardinia.
[16:48 --> 16:49] There was nothing the triumvirate
[16:49 --> 16:50] could have done about that,
[16:50 --> 16:52] so he had bargained for control
[16:52 --> 16:54] over things he already controlled.
[16:54 --> 16:56] In return, he had given up the mantle
[16:56 --> 16:58] of last defender of the Republic.
[17:00 --> 17:02] The money and support that flooded his way
[17:02 --> 17:04] for playing this part suddenly dried up.
[17:05 --> 17:07] All his allies had returned home or given up on him.
[17:08 --> 17:10] Octavian was no fan of the agreement either,
[17:11 --> 17:13] but with the situation in the West finally settled,
[17:14 --> 17:15] Antony clapped down on any talk
[17:15 --> 17:17] of further aggression against Sexis.
[17:18 --> 17:19] He needed things quiet in Rome
[17:19 --> 17:21] if he was ever going to get
[17:21 --> 17:24] the eternally delayed Parthian campaign off the ground.
[17:24 --> 17:27] But by 38 BC, with Antony back in the East
[17:27 --> 17:30] planning his war and Sexis disrupting
[17:30 --> 17:32] the grain supply again in an attempt to stay relevant,
[17:33 --> 17:35] Octavian decided to ignore his colleagues' wishes
[17:35 --> 17:38] and deal with the meddlesome Pompey once and for all.
[17:39 --> 17:42] With the defection of one of Sexis's top captains,
[17:42 --> 17:44] Octavian decided to strike while the iron was hot.
[17:45 --> 17:47] He now knew where young Pompey was
[17:47 --> 17:49] and exactly what his defenses were.
[17:50 --> 17:52] If he could clear Sexis off the table quickly,
[17:53 --> 17:54] Antony would return from the East
[17:54 --> 17:57] with Octavian the undisputed ruler of the Western Empire.
[17:57 --> 17:59] It was a seductive thought
[17:59 --> 18:02] and so he voided the treaty with Sexis and attacked.
[18:04 --> 18:06] Octavian planned a two-pronged assault of Sicily.
[18:07 --> 18:09] He ordered a fleet led by Sexis's ex-captain
[18:09 --> 18:12] to sail south and attack the north coast of the island.
[18:13 --> 18:15] Meanwhile, the driver himself
[18:15 --> 18:17] would lead another force in from the East.
[18:17 --> 18:20] He hoped to quickly pin Sexis down in Massona
[18:20 --> 18:22] just across the straits from mainland Italy.
[18:23 --> 18:26] But this initial thrust turned into a complete debacle.
[18:27 --> 18:29] The fleet coming south was challenged,
[18:29 --> 18:30] defeated, and forced to retreat.
[18:32 --> 18:33] Octavian quickly shifted his plans
[18:33 --> 18:35] and decided to try to rush through the straits
[18:35 --> 18:38] of Massona and link up with the retreating fleet.
[18:38 --> 18:39] Two prongs were nice,
[18:40 --> 18:42] but if this wasn't going to be as easy as he thought,
[18:42 --> 18:45] one great big prong was better than two little prongs.
[18:46 --> 18:48] But Octavian was an inexperienced naval commander
[18:48 --> 18:50] and as soon as he set sail,
[18:50 --> 18:53] Sexis pounced and drove Octavian's fleet into the rocks.
[18:54 --> 18:56] Octavian barely escaped with his life.
[18:56 --> 18:58] Most of his fleet was either on fire
[18:58 --> 19:00] or dashed on the rocks.
[19:01 --> 19:02] In a cruel twist of fate,
[19:02 --> 19:04] the next morning Octavian and the survivors
[19:04 --> 19:06] awoke to a sudden storm
[19:06 --> 19:09] and what few ships they had left sunk.
[19:10 --> 19:12] Octavian struck while the iron was hot all right
[19:12 --> 19:13] and it burned him badly.
[19:15 --> 19:17] Humiliated but undeterred,
[19:18 --> 19:20] Octavian called for Agrippa to help plan a new invasion.
[19:21 --> 19:23] To give his friend all the resources he needed,
[19:24 --> 19:26] Octavian had the 26-year-old appointed consul
[19:26 --> 19:27] for the year 37 BC.
[19:29 --> 19:31] That whole year was spent building a new fleet.
[19:32 --> 19:34] But because Octavian wanted to lull Sexis
[19:34 --> 19:36] into a false sense of security
[19:36 --> 19:38] and because any attempt to construct anything
[19:38 --> 19:40] in a regular port would likely be harassed
[19:40 --> 19:41] by constant attack,
[19:42 --> 19:44] Agrippa designed and built canals
[19:44 --> 19:46] linking an inland lake to the sea.
[19:46 --> 19:49] Then, under the cover of a dense forest, out of sight,
[19:50 --> 19:53] he built and trained a massive new navy on the lake.
[19:54 --> 19:56] Of more immediate importance to Octavian,
[19:57 --> 19:59] on January the 1st, 37 BC,
[19:59 --> 20:01] the same day that Agrippa assumed the consulship,
[20:02 --> 20:05] the term of the second triumvirate officially expired.
[20:06 --> 20:08] He and Antony were still in power, obviously,
[20:08 --> 20:10] but technically they had no standing
[20:10 --> 20:11] within the political system.
[20:12 --> 20:14] So a summit was scheduled to work out the details
[20:14 --> 20:15] of renewing the pact.
[20:16 --> 20:18] Antony returned from the east
[20:18 --> 20:20] and his opening skirmishes with the Parthians
[20:20 --> 20:22] in the spring, and at Tarentum,
[20:22 --> 20:24] he and Octavian met and hashed out the terms.
[20:25 --> 20:27] It was roughly the same deal as before.
[20:27 --> 20:30] Octavian would control the west and Antony the east.
[20:31 --> 20:33] This time, rather than sealing the deal with a marriage,
[20:34 --> 20:35] a troop exchange was arranged.
[20:36 --> 20:39] Octavian needed ships for his war with Sextus,
[20:39 --> 20:41] and Antony needed ground legions
[20:41 --> 20:42] for his invasion of Parthia.
[20:43 --> 20:46] So Antony traded 120 ships for four of Octavian's legions.
[20:47 --> 20:49] But in a move that would sow the seeds
[20:49 --> 20:51] for the demise of the triumvirate,
[20:51 --> 20:53] while Antony duly sent the ships,
[20:53 --> 20:56] Octavian refused to live up to his end of the bargain
[20:56 --> 20:58] and never sent the promised legions.
[20:59 --> 21:00] Antony was furious at the betrayal
[21:00 --> 21:03] and it destroyed whatever trust he had left
[21:03 --> 21:04] in his partner for good.
[21:04 --> 21:06] War between them was now inevitable.
[21:06 --> 21:08] It was just a matter of time.
[21:10 --> 21:13] Agrippa shepherded the renewal of the triumvirate
[21:13 --> 21:14] through the Senate and the assemblies,
[21:15 --> 21:16] and having placed his friend back in official power,
[21:17 --> 21:19] returned to the fleet that he would lead against Sextus.
[21:20 --> 21:23] In the spring of 36 BC, the 300 ships,
[21:24 --> 21:26] each bigger than anything Sextus commanded
[21:26 --> 21:27] and equipped with the latest
[21:27 --> 21:29] in grappling hook technology,
[21:29 --> 21:30] sailed out into the Mediterranean.
[21:31 --> 21:33] For this latest attempt to conquer Sicily,
[21:34 --> 21:36] Octavian now envisioned a three-prong assault.
[21:37 --> 21:39] With Agrippa attacking the north coast,
[21:39 --> 21:42] he ordered Lepidus to land 10 legions on the southern coast
[21:42 --> 21:45] and begin capturing as much territory as possible.
[21:46 --> 21:48] With Sextus busy fighting on two fronts,
[21:48 --> 21:50] Octavian himself would ferry more ground legions
[21:50 --> 21:52] across the straits.
[21:52 --> 21:53] Sextus would be overwhelmed.
[21:55 --> 21:56] At first things went great.
[21:57 --> 21:59] Lepidus landed and began capturing city after city,
[22:00 --> 22:02] but when Agrippa attacked from the north,
[22:02 --> 22:04] Sextus suspected that it was just a feint
[22:04 --> 22:07] meant to distract from whatever Octavian was up to.
[22:08 --> 22:09] So he left just enough ships
[22:09 --> 22:11] to make a nice show of fighting Agrippa
[22:11 --> 22:13] and led the rest around the horn
[22:13 --> 22:15] into the straits of Massana.
[22:15 --> 22:18] Octavian, thinking he had outsmarted Sextus,
[22:18 --> 22:20] had landed with a force to establish a beachhead
[22:20 --> 22:22] and then found himself trapped
[22:22 --> 22:24] by the sudden appearance of Sextus' fleet.
[22:25 --> 22:27] Braving possible capture,
[22:27 --> 22:28] Octavian slipped through the blockade
[22:28 --> 22:30] and a small ship to link back up
[22:30 --> 22:31] with the rest of his army.
[22:32 --> 22:33] It was do or die time now.
[22:33 --> 22:36] He had to get the rest of his army into Sicily,
[22:36 --> 22:37] or all would be lost.
[22:38 --> 22:39] Rumors were already filtering in
[22:39 --> 22:42] that Lepidus was talking alliance with Sextus.
[22:42 --> 22:45] Octavian needed to fill the island with his own men
[22:45 --> 22:46] before any deal was struck.
[22:48 --> 22:50] Luckily though, Sextus was spread thin
[22:50 --> 22:53] and only had 300 ships left at his disposal.
[22:54 --> 22:56] With so many blockading the straits,
[22:56 --> 22:57] he was forced to leave
[22:57 --> 22:59] some of the northern ports defenseless.
[23:00 --> 23:02] Agrippa was able to easily capture and hold them.
[23:03 --> 23:05] Octavian hooked back up with his legions on the mainland
[23:05 --> 23:07] and sailed them north to land
[23:07 --> 23:09] under the protection of Agrippa's fleet.
[23:10 --> 23:12] Pretty soon, the transfer was complete.
[23:12 --> 23:14] Totally outnumbered on land,
[23:14 --> 23:16] Sextus gathered all of his ships
[23:16 --> 23:17] at his stronghold in Massana.
[23:18 --> 23:20] The only hope he had left now
[23:20 --> 23:21] was to provoke a sea battle.
[23:22 --> 23:25] In early September, he led his ships out of the harbor
[23:25 --> 23:26] and went looking for Agrippa.
[23:27 --> 23:30] The two fleets met off the northeast coast
[23:30 --> 23:32] of the island near the city of Neloches.
[23:32 --> 23:35] On paper, it was an even engagement,
[23:35 --> 23:37] east side controlling 300 ships.
[23:37 --> 23:40] But Agrippa's fleet was larger and more powerful.
[23:40 --> 23:42] It was by no means a one sided affair,
[23:43 --> 23:44] but throughout the whole day's fighting,
[23:45 --> 23:47] Sextus lost ships at a slightly faster rate.
[23:48 --> 23:49] By the end of the day,
[23:49 --> 23:52] the Pompeian captains determined that the cause was lost
[23:52 --> 23:53] and began to surrender to Agrippa
[23:53 --> 23:55] rather than keep fighting.
[23:56 --> 23:57] With his navy captured,
[23:57 --> 23:58] it was all over for Sextus.
[23:59 --> 24:02] He took the 17 ships that remained uncaptured
[24:02 --> 24:03] and sailed east.
[24:04 --> 24:05] Over the course of the next year,
[24:05 --> 24:07] he tried to find asylum and allies,
[24:08 --> 24:09] but was rebuked at every turn.
[24:10 --> 24:11] Unwilling to surrender,
[24:11 --> 24:13] he was eventually captured in Anatolia
[24:13 --> 24:15] and executed by a provincial governor
[24:15 --> 24:17] loyal to the triumvirate.
[24:19 --> 24:21] After Agrippa's victory at Neloches,
[24:21 --> 24:23] Octavian now stood alone in the west.
[24:24 --> 24:26] There was no one left to challenge his rule.
[24:27 --> 24:28] Well, almost no one.
[24:29 --> 24:31] Lepidus, who had conquered most of Sicily
[24:31 --> 24:32] during the invasion,
[24:32 --> 24:35] suddenly decided to reassert himself in the triumvirate.
[24:36 --> 24:38] He claimed by right of conquest Sicily,
[24:38 --> 24:39] Sardinia, and Corsica,
[24:39 --> 24:42] and demanded that Octavian recognize his claim.
[24:43 --> 24:45] Octavian scoffed at this notion.
[24:45 --> 24:47] He had not gone through all this trouble to take Sicily
[24:47 --> 24:49] just to give it away to a rival.
[24:50 --> 24:52] He sent men into the ranks of Lepidus' legions
[24:52 --> 24:53] to sow dissent.
[24:54 --> 24:56] Lepidus, who was never very popular
[24:56 --> 24:57] with the average grunt,
[24:57 --> 25:00] watched in horror as his legions began to desert
[25:00 --> 25:01] from his banner and mask.
[25:02 --> 25:04] Without any leverage left,
[25:04 --> 25:07] Lepidus met with Octavian and rescinded his claim.
[25:08 --> 25:11] Octavian, seizing an opportunity to eliminate Lepidus
[25:11 --> 25:12] from the balance of power,
[25:12 --> 25:14] decided to unilaterally expel him
[25:14 --> 25:15] from the triumvirate as punishment.
[25:17 --> 25:19] From now on, though the name never caught on,
[25:19 --> 25:21] it truly was a biumvirate.
[25:22 --> 25:24] Lepidus retired to a plush estate
[25:24 --> 25:25] on the Italian coast
[25:25 --> 25:28] and lived in another 20 years in comfortable obscurity.
[25:30 --> 25:34] Next week, we'll head east to trace the ups and downs
[25:34 --> 25:36] of Antony's campaigns against the Parthians.
[25:36 --> 25:39] But as I said before, it was more downs than ups.
[25:40 --> 25:43] The apex of Antony's career was the Battle of Philippi.
[25:43 --> 25:46] Everything after that was just a slow descent into ruin.
[25:48 --> 25:49] Completely in control of the West now,
[25:50 --> 25:52] Octavian would use every tool at his disposal
[25:52 --> 25:54] to turn public opinion against his colleague,
[25:55 --> 25:56] particularly harping on the fact
[25:56 --> 25:58] that Antony seemed to be going native,
[25:59 --> 26:00] dressing in Eastern fashion
[26:00 --> 26:04] and living a life of scandalous adultery with Cleopatra.
[26:04 --> 26:06] Octavian told anyone who would listen
[26:06 --> 26:09] that the new Dionysus had lost touch with Roman values.
[26:10 --> 26:12] Roman values that were of course
[26:12 --> 26:15] exemplified by Octavian, the new Apollo.

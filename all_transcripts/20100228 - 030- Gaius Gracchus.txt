[00:04 --> 00:07] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:14] Last week, we discussed the career of Tiberius Gracchus, whose extreme populism helped kick
[00:14 --> 00:18] start the century of civil strife that would be the Republic's undoing.
[00:19 --> 00:23] This is not to say that Tiberius was to blame for the downward spiral, but he
[00:23 --> 00:28] certainly staked out a position that forced the Senate to stake out a reactionary
[00:28 --> 00:33] position, and it was this polarization, not one side or the other necessarily,
[00:33 --> 00:38] that eventually led the Roman people to the safe and comforting arms of Caesar Augustus.
[00:40 --> 00:44] Hot on the heels of that number one summer blockbuster, Tiberius Gracchus,
[00:45 --> 00:49] man of the people, came its sequel, Gaius, Revenge of the Gracchii.
[00:50 --> 00:53] And like all good sequels, they took what made the original work,
[00:53 --> 00:57] doubled the special effects budget, and quadrupled the size of the crises.
[00:58 --> 01:03] If protagonist Tiberius had to save the city, Gaius would be tasked with saving the whole world.
[01:04 --> 01:08] What I mean to say by all that is that Tiberius entered office,
[01:08 --> 01:12] focused on the single issue of agrarian reform, and met his downfall running for
[01:12 --> 01:17] an illegal second term. His brother would pick up the baton on agrarian reform,
[01:18 --> 01:21] but also add a whole slate of other populist reform measures.
[01:21 --> 01:24] And where Tiberius failed to win his second term as tribune,
[01:24 --> 01:29] Gaius succeeded and met his own downfall, seeking an unprecedented third term.
[01:30 --> 01:34] The sequel always has to be bigger, better, and go further than the original.
[01:34 --> 01:35] It's just good marketing.
[01:38 --> 01:41] Gaius was born in 154 BC, the same year his father died.
[01:42 --> 01:45] So where Tiberius at least had some contact with their father,
[01:45 --> 01:47] Gaius was raised entirely by their mother.
[01:48 --> 01:52] He was destined to live his life in the footsteps of his brother,
[01:52 --> 01:54] who's 14 years his elder.
[01:55 --> 01:59] The entire career of Gaius Gracchus was defined by the path his brother had cut
[01:59 --> 01:59] through the wilderness.
[02:00 --> 02:04] It was a combination of family obligation and personal revenge that drove
[02:04 --> 02:07] Gaius to press his ambitious reform platform.
[02:07 --> 02:11] And for the most part, the younger Gracchus did not have much choice.
[02:12 --> 02:15] The supporters of Tiberius and the legions of clients that had built up
[02:15 --> 02:19] around the family expected him to carry on the legacy, and Gaius simply
[02:19 --> 02:22] could not turn away from those expectations.
[02:24 --> 02:28] Gaius even began his career in similar fashion to his brother,
[02:28 --> 02:31] attached to the staff of their much older brother-in-law,
[02:31 --> 02:32] Scipio Aemilianus.
[02:33 --> 02:35] Like Tiberius, he served in Numantia,
[02:36 --> 02:39] though was not there at the time of the campaign that so changed
[02:39 --> 02:40] Tiberius's life.
[02:41 --> 02:44] And where Tiberius was driven to his extreme populism because of a very
[02:44 --> 02:48] public rebuking by the Senate, Gaius was driven by the very public
[02:48 --> 02:51] murder of his brother by those same senators.
[02:52 --> 02:57] His brother's death left Gaius at 21, the patriarch of the wealthy and
[02:57 --> 02:58] influential Gracchus family.
[03:00 --> 03:04] For a few years, Gaius did attempt to pull back from a public career,
[03:04 --> 03:06] declining to run for office when he came of age.
[03:07 --> 03:10] Though, like I say, he couldn't avoid the pressure to follow in the
[03:10 --> 03:15] footsteps of his brother, father, grandfather, and ancestors in every
[03:15 --> 03:15] direction.
[03:16 --> 03:19] Gaius was marked for a public career and there was nothing he could do
[03:19 --> 03:21] about it.
[03:22 --> 03:27] In 126 BC, he was elected questor and was assigned by lot to a post
[03:27 --> 03:30] in Sardinia and by all accounts served as an able administrator.
[03:32 --> 03:35] But it was on the island that Gaius found himself becoming personally
[03:35 --> 03:37] embittered towards the Senate in his own right,
[03:37 --> 03:40] not just for real and perceived slights against his family,
[03:41 --> 03:43] but slights directed at him personally.
[03:45 --> 03:50] As questor, Gaius served under the consul Lucius Orestes and in Roman
[03:50 --> 03:53] tradition, if a consul was kept on in a certain territory,
[03:53 --> 03:56] becoming a proconsul, then his officers stayed with him.
[03:57 --> 04:01] In Rome, political class tensions continued to simmer after the
[04:01 --> 04:04] death of Tiberius and the Senate was keen to keep Tiberius' younger
[04:04 --> 04:07] brother out of the city while they undid all his work.
[04:08 --> 04:12] So they voted to keep Orestes stationed in Sardinia and Gaius was
[04:12 --> 04:14] forced to stay on.
[04:14 --> 04:18] Another year passed and the Senate voted to keep Orestes on again.
[04:18 --> 04:21] Gaius began to feel like the Senate was doing this on purpose.
[04:22 --> 04:25] So when the Senate again voted Orestes proconsul for Sardinia,
[04:25 --> 04:27] Gaius denounced he was leaving the island.
[04:29 --> 04:30] There was nothing illegal about leaving,
[04:30 --> 04:33] but it was completely unheard of.
[04:33 --> 04:37] And so a Gracchae managed again to turn a binding cultural norm
[04:37 --> 04:38] into so much hot air.
[04:40 --> 04:45] He returned to Rome and in 123 BC was elected tribune of the plebs
[04:45 --> 04:47] like his father and brother before him.
[04:48 --> 04:51] The sources differ as to whether Gaius entered office with a
[04:51 --> 04:55] revolutionary slate of proposals in hand or whether his
[04:55 --> 04:57] platform grew organically as a response to circumstance.
[04:58 --> 05:01] What is not disputed is that by the time he left office,
[05:01 --> 05:04] almost every aspect of Roman society had been touched by
[05:04 --> 05:07] one or another of his proposed reforms.
[05:09 --> 05:12] He began innocuously enough addressing an issue that is
[05:12 --> 05:14] actually in the headlines today,
[05:14 --> 05:16] skyrocketing grain prices.
[05:17 --> 05:20] Though the slave revolt in Sicily had been put down,
[05:20 --> 05:24] a plague of locusts, yes, a plague of locusts,
[05:24 --> 05:26] had swept through North Africa and there was a
[05:26 --> 05:28] general shortage of grain coming into Rome.
[05:29 --> 05:33] The city, swollen with poor and landless families,
[05:33 --> 05:36] faced outrageous markups on basic food staples.
[05:37 --> 05:39] The conditions that caused the shortages were real enough,
[05:40 --> 05:42] but merchants were having a field day,
[05:42 --> 05:44] taking full advantage of the panic in the streets.
[05:45 --> 05:48] Gaius simply pushed through a cap on the price of grain.
[05:49 --> 05:52] Essentially the Roman state began to bring in grain and
[05:52 --> 05:54] settled at far below the inflated market rate.
[05:55 --> 05:58] This transferred the burden of the price spike off the
[05:58 --> 06:00] backs of the poor city dwellers and onto the
[06:00 --> 06:02] collective back of the state treasury.
[06:03 --> 06:06] The Senate was by no means pleased at Gaius' ingenious
[06:06 --> 06:09] plan to invert basic economic common sense,
[06:09 --> 06:12] buying high while selling low,
[06:12 --> 06:15] but it did solve a pressing social concern
[06:15 --> 06:16] and the people loved it,
[06:16 --> 06:19] so there was only so much the elites felt they could do.
[06:20 --> 06:22] In Gaius' grain plan,
[06:22 --> 06:25] we find the seeds of the later full on food welfare
[06:25 --> 06:28] program that became so important during the Imperium,
[06:29 --> 06:30] but for now at least,
[06:30 --> 06:33] the Roman state merely provided food at a normal price
[06:33 --> 06:35] and was not yet handing it out for free.
[06:37 --> 06:39] With the people now fully behind him,
[06:39 --> 06:41] Gaius turned to settling old family scores.
[06:42 --> 06:45] He passed a measure making it a crime to re-stand
[06:45 --> 06:47] for the tribunate if the assembly voted
[06:47 --> 06:49] to remove an officer from power.
[06:50 --> 06:52] Gaius wanted to be clear that standing in the way
[06:52 --> 06:54] of popular will was the shortest route
[06:54 --> 06:56] to complete irrelevance.
[06:56 --> 06:57] While at the same time,
[06:57 --> 07:00] he wanted to legitimize Tiberius' recall vote
[07:00 --> 07:02] of Octavius 10 years before,
[07:02 --> 07:05] which had a very shaky legal foundation at the time.
[07:07 --> 07:09] Gaius also passed a measure making it a crime
[07:09 --> 07:11] to hand down capital punishment
[07:11 --> 07:13] without the approval of the assembly.
[07:14 --> 07:15] This measure was aimed directly
[07:15 --> 07:17] in an ex-consul named Laenus,
[07:18 --> 07:20] who had overseen the trials and executions
[07:20 --> 07:24] of many of Tiberius' associates in 132 BC
[07:24 --> 07:26] after the elder Grocki was killed.
[07:27 --> 07:29] Gaius' new law contained the provision
[07:29 --> 07:31] that it applied retroactively
[07:31 --> 07:33] and Laenus was forced into exile
[07:33 --> 07:36] for an act that was only later determined to be a crime.
[07:37 --> 07:38] In most countries today,
[07:38 --> 07:40] these kind of ex post facto,
[07:40 --> 07:42] or literally after the fact,
[07:42 --> 07:44] laws are explicitly prohibited
[07:44 --> 07:46] as being an obvious source of mischief.
[07:49 --> 07:50] Old scores settled,
[07:50 --> 07:53] Gaius returned to what had made his brother
[07:53 --> 07:55] so popular to begin with, agrarian reform.
[07:57 --> 07:58] The agrarian commission,
[07:58 --> 08:01] which had been rendered impotent in 129 BC,
[08:01 --> 08:04] was rebooted and the process of identifying
[08:04 --> 08:06] illegally held land and redistributing it
[08:06 --> 08:08] was taken up again in earnest.
[08:09 --> 08:12] Gaius followed this with laws on military service.
[08:12 --> 08:15] Henceforth, no one under 17 was to be drafted
[08:15 --> 08:17] and limits were put on the total number
[08:17 --> 08:19] of years of service required.
[08:20 --> 08:23] Also, an important step in the evolution of the army,
[08:24 --> 08:25] Grockus demanded that the state
[08:25 --> 08:27] provide soldiers with adequate clothing.
[08:28 --> 08:30] During his time in Sardinia,
[08:30 --> 08:33] he had witnessed firsthand drafted legionaries,
[08:33 --> 08:36] freezing and miserable from a lack of proper supplies.
[08:37 --> 08:40] It was a necessary provision to deal with real suffering,
[08:40 --> 08:42] but it was another step on the road
[08:42 --> 08:44] to the full-blown state funded armies
[08:44 --> 08:46] that would tear the country apart in the years to come.
[08:50 --> 08:52] Rounding out his first year in office,
[08:52 --> 08:54] Gaius worked to reform the law courts,
[08:55 --> 08:57] opening up the jury pool beyond the senatorial class,
[08:58 --> 09:00] which had long held the strings of justice
[09:00 --> 09:03] and creating a commission to investigate charges of bribery,
[09:04 --> 09:06] a rampant problem that had been ignored for years.
[09:08 --> 09:09] It had been a remarkable year
[09:09 --> 09:12] and Gaius' popularity was at an all-time high.
[09:13 --> 09:14] Because of this popularity,
[09:15 --> 09:17] Gaius was able to, through no fault of his own,
[09:17 --> 09:19] to succeed where his brother had failed
[09:19 --> 09:21] and win another term in office.
[09:22 --> 09:24] He had not even actively campaigned,
[09:24 --> 09:25] but the assembly had failed
[09:25 --> 09:27] to grant him majority to 10 tribunes,
[09:28 --> 09:29] so the final slots were appointed
[09:29 --> 09:31] by those tribunes who had won a majority,
[09:32 --> 09:33] and they named Gaius,
[09:33 --> 09:35] who though he had not sought the office,
[09:35 --> 09:37] eagerly accepted their appointment.
[09:39 --> 09:41] In his second term,
[09:41 --> 09:42] Gaius brought to the table
[09:42 --> 09:44] one of the thorniest issues of the day
[09:44 --> 09:46] and dropped it right in the middle
[09:46 --> 09:48] of an already chaotic political environment.
[09:50 --> 09:52] The question was on the rights of non-Roman Italians
[09:52 --> 09:55] and specifically whether they should be made full citizens.
[09:57 --> 09:58] One of Gaius' fellow tribunes
[09:58 --> 10:01] was a former consul named Marcus Fulvius,
[10:01 --> 10:05] who had championed Italian citizenship in 125 BC.
[10:05 --> 10:08] It was, in fact, Fulvius' proposal
[10:08 --> 10:11] that had inspired the Senate to keep Gracchus in Sardinia.
[10:13 --> 10:15] Italian citizenship was an idea whose time had come,
[10:15 --> 10:17] but the Senate still balked at the idea
[10:17 --> 10:19] of extending full rights to non-Romans.
[10:20 --> 10:21] One of their greatest fears
[10:21 --> 10:24] was that if they allowed populist reformers
[10:24 --> 10:25] like Gracchus and Fulvius
[10:25 --> 10:27] to bring the vote to the Italian allies,
[10:27 --> 10:29] they would be rewarded with thousands and thousands
[10:29 --> 10:31] of new clients ready to vote
[10:31 --> 10:33] any way the tribunes directed them.
[10:34 --> 10:36] It was an irrational fear as many of the Italians
[10:36 --> 10:38] were feeling the brunt
[10:38 --> 10:40] of the agrarian commission's redistribution efforts
[10:40 --> 10:43] and had no great love for Gracchus,
[10:43 --> 10:44] but the conservatives in the Senate
[10:44 --> 10:47] began to see boogeymen around every corner.
[10:49 --> 10:50] Gaius worked on other issues
[10:50 --> 10:52] in addition to the citizenship proposal,
[10:53 --> 10:54] shoring up the treasury
[10:54 --> 10:57] by increasing the efficiency of provisional tax collection
[10:57 --> 11:00] and attempting to release some of the population pressures
[11:00 --> 11:02] on Rome by establishing colonies overseas.
[11:04 --> 11:06] In total, Gaius' year and a half or so in office
[11:06 --> 11:10] had seen him touch almost every aspect of the social order
[11:10 --> 11:12] and universally acting in opposition
[11:12 --> 11:14] to whatever the conservatives in the Senate
[11:14 --> 11:15] wanted.
[11:16 --> 11:17] Near the end of his second term,
[11:18 --> 11:19] Gaius sailed for Carthage
[11:19 --> 11:22] where one of his proposed colonies was being built.
[11:23 --> 11:26] While he was gone, his voice and charisma left with him
[11:26 --> 11:29] and his enemies began to openly plot the downfall
[11:29 --> 11:30] of the troublesome tribune.
[11:32 --> 11:33] When Gaius returned,
[11:33 --> 11:36] he found his allies had one by one been turned
[11:36 --> 11:38] against him and that all his reforms were threatened
[11:38 --> 11:40] by outright repeal.
[11:41 --> 11:44] The only option Gaius felt he had available to him
[11:44 --> 11:47] was to tempt fate and do the only thing more unthinkable
[11:47 --> 11:49] than serving his tribune for two terms,
[11:49 --> 11:51] serving for three terms.
[11:52 --> 11:53] This time though,
[11:53 --> 11:55] his support amongst the non-Senatorial elites
[11:55 --> 11:57] was at an all-time low
[11:57 --> 12:00] as a mixture of bribes and threats had done their work.
[12:01 --> 12:02] Gracchus was forced to fully embrace
[12:02 --> 12:04] the persona of man of the people
[12:04 --> 12:05] and hoped that he would be able
[12:05 --> 12:07] to drum up enough votes to win.
[12:08 --> 12:11] He moved from his estate on the Palatine Hill
[12:11 --> 12:12] down into a local slum
[12:12 --> 12:15] and began, with the help of his Greek speechwriters,
[12:16 --> 12:18] to launch into full-throated populist campaign mode.
[12:19 --> 12:22] He even went so far as to tear down a set of risers
[12:22 --> 12:25] the wealthy would view an upcoming gladiatorial match from
[12:25 --> 12:28] because they blocked the view of the commoners.
[12:29 --> 12:31] But despite his desperate campaign,
[12:31 --> 12:33] Gracchus was defeated in the polls.
[12:34 --> 12:36] There were of course accusations of fraud
[12:36 --> 12:38] and we will never know whether Gracchus
[12:38 --> 12:39] actually won or not,
[12:39 --> 12:42] but officially he was out and the new tribunes
[12:42 --> 12:44] to a man enemies of Gracchus
[12:44 --> 12:47] set about dismantling all his reforms.
[12:49 --> 12:50] Gracchus and his colleague Fulvius
[12:50 --> 12:53] made the fateful decision to muster
[12:53 --> 12:55] a series of public demonstrations against repeal
[12:55 --> 12:57] that took on an increasingly violent
[12:57 --> 12:59] and seditious overtone.
[13:00 --> 13:01] At one of these gatherings,
[13:01 --> 13:03] a herald of Gracchus's chief opponent
[13:03 --> 13:06] was killed by overzealous Gracchus supporters.
[13:07 --> 13:09] As soon as the body hit the ground,
[13:09 --> 13:11] Gaius knew he was undone.
[13:11 --> 13:13] The tribunate did not waste time
[13:13 --> 13:14] leaping from a murder charge
[13:14 --> 13:17] against the men actually responsible for the crime
[13:17 --> 13:19] to a full-blown charge of treason
[13:19 --> 13:21] against Gaius and Fulvius.
[13:22 --> 13:24] The two were immediately named enemies of the state
[13:24 --> 13:26] and were forced to run.
[13:27 --> 13:29] Fulvius was caught and murdered along with his two sons
[13:29 --> 13:32] while Gaius fled with one of his slaves.
[13:33 --> 13:35] Cornered and knowing that capture meant only disgrace
[13:35 --> 13:37] followed by execution,
[13:37 --> 13:39] he decided to skip the former
[13:39 --> 13:42] and ordered his loyal slave to perform the latter.
[13:43 --> 13:46] A murder-suicide later, they were both dead.
[13:46 --> 13:48] And just like that, the Gracchae,
[13:48 --> 13:50] who had so dominated Roman politics
[13:50 --> 13:52] for the last decade, were gone.
[13:55 --> 13:59] Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus left an indelible mark on Rome
[13:59 --> 14:01] and changed the character of its society forever.
[14:03 --> 14:05] Whatever the hopes of their political opponents,
[14:05 --> 14:08] the Gracchian reforms could not simply be undone.
[14:08 --> 14:11] It would take too much violence to remove citizens
[14:11 --> 14:13] from their newly created farms,
[14:13 --> 14:15] and besides, the negative press
[14:15 --> 14:16] would be far too much to overcome.
[14:17 --> 14:20] Of all his proposals, the only one to truly die
[14:20 --> 14:22] was the matter of Italian citizenship.
[14:23 --> 14:25] That would be tabled for another 30 years
[14:25 --> 14:27] and require a full-blown revolt
[14:27 --> 14:29] before the Italian allies were treated
[14:29 --> 14:30] as equals within the state.
[14:32 --> 14:35] I believe I mentioned after the end of the Samnite Wars
[14:35 --> 14:37] that the Samnites would return with a vengeance
[14:37 --> 14:39] in a few hundred years.
[14:39 --> 14:41] Well, that time is fast approaching,
[14:41 --> 14:43] as they would be leaders in the violence
[14:43 --> 14:44] that led to citizenship.
[14:46 --> 14:48] The Senate could have saved itself a lot of blood
[14:48 --> 14:50] and treasure by simply recognizing the inevitability
[14:50 --> 14:52] of extending citizenship,
[14:52 --> 14:54] but sometimes things have to get out of hand
[14:54 --> 14:57] before the hand finally loosens its grip.
[14:59 --> 15:01] Beyond their legal reforms,
[15:01 --> 15:04] the Gracchae introduced the idea of mob violence
[15:04 --> 15:06] and mob pressure to Roman politics.
[15:08 --> 15:10] Until now, the elites have been careful
[15:10 --> 15:13] not to empower the masses or hint to them in any way
[15:13 --> 15:15] that they far outnumbered their leaders
[15:15 --> 15:17] and could, if they wanted to,
[15:17 --> 15:20] get their way by sheer physical intimidation.
[15:21 --> 15:23] Sure, the early history of the Republic
[15:23 --> 15:25] saw a few secession of the plebs,
[15:25 --> 15:28] but that was passive civil disobedience,
[15:28 --> 15:29] not rioting in the streets.
[15:31 --> 15:33] And the lesson of mob violence
[15:33 --> 15:35] was a lesson well-learned by the next generations,
[15:36 --> 15:38] and the streets of Rome will soon run red
[15:38 --> 15:41] with the blood of mobs and counter mobs
[15:41 --> 15:42] crashing into one another,
[15:42 --> 15:45] egged on by leaders who crave power at any cost.
[15:47 --> 15:50] Next week, we will introduce one of those leaders
[15:50 --> 15:52] who learned the lessons of the Gracchae all too well.
[15:53 --> 15:56] It will take at least two and possibly three episodes
[15:56 --> 15:58] to cover the entire career of Gaius Marius,
[15:59 --> 16:01] but his career is one of the most important
[16:01 --> 16:02] in the late Republic,
[16:03 --> 16:05] and it bears going into in some detail,
[16:06 --> 16:08] because the mark he would leave on the Republic
[16:08 --> 16:11] would soon come to resemble the kiss of death,
[16:11 --> 16:14] as Julius Caesar would follow his father-in-law's career
[16:14 --> 16:15] to its logical conclusion
[16:15 --> 16:19] and have himself declared dictator for life.

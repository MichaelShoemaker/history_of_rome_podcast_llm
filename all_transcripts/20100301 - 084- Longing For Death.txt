[00:00 --> 00:14] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 84, Longing for Death.
[00:14 --> 00:18] Hadrian had been in Athens when word came in 132 that another revolt had broken out
[00:18 --> 00:19] in Judea.
[00:19 --> 00:25] The two and a half years of fighting to retake the province would prove to be the most significant
[00:25 --> 00:30] military operation Rome would engage in during Hadrian's reign, and it is likely, bordering
[00:30 --> 00:35] on confirmed fact, that the emperor traveled to the troubled region to oversee the campaign
[00:35 --> 00:37] for himself.
[00:37 --> 00:42] But he did not stick around to see the conflict's resolution, and by 134 the emperor was back
[00:42 --> 00:47] in Italy, having left the prosecution of the war in the hands of his best general, Sextus
[00:47 --> 00:49] Julius Severus.
[00:49 --> 00:53] This final trip back from the east would mark Hadrian's last tour as the great traveling
[00:53 --> 00:58] emperor, and when he settled into his villa at Tivoli, whether he knew it or not, he
[00:58 --> 01:02] was settling in for good.
[01:02 --> 01:06] By all accounts, the last few years of Hadrian's reign were unhappy ones, both for the emperor
[01:06 --> 01:10] himself and for everyone around him.
[01:10 --> 01:15] His mental and physical health began to deteriorate, and as his life grew shorter, so too did his
[01:15 --> 01:17] temper.
[01:17 --> 01:22] The image of himself Hadrian had worked so hard to create, that of a patient, generous,
[01:22 --> 01:27] enlightened monarch, began to fall apart, and all the close friends and associates who
[01:27 --> 01:33] had stood by his side through thick and thin began to be pushed away one by one.
[01:33 --> 01:37] Hadrian had been proud to call the best and brightest the empire had to offer his personal
[01:37 --> 01:38] friends.
[01:38 --> 01:42] When he died, though, he was attended by none but a few slaves.
[01:42 --> 01:47] Every man who should have stood by the emperor as he slipped away was either dead or exiled,
[01:47 --> 01:52] or had chosen to withdraw from a ruler who seemed to be lashing out at those he trusted
[01:52 --> 01:55] and who trusted him the most.
[01:55 --> 02:00] Those who knew him best saw Hadrian's final years as a departure from his natural disposition,
[02:00 --> 02:04] while his enemies in the senate saw it as confirmation that he had been a monster all
[02:04 --> 02:07] along.
[02:07 --> 02:11] For a while after he returned to Italy, things seemed to be okay.
[02:11 --> 02:15] Hadrian, naturally feeling the effects of nearly two decades on the throne, began to
[02:15 --> 02:19] think about what the world would be like when he was gone.
[02:19 --> 02:24] Frequent, unstoppable nosebleeds had him thinking about his own mortality.
[02:24 --> 02:28] Who would follow him on the throne, and how would history remember him?
[02:28 --> 02:33] Much like Augustus, Hadrian displayed concern about the future of both the imperial dynasty
[02:33 --> 02:36] and the empire as a whole.
[02:36 --> 02:40] For an emperor obsessed with the stability and strength of Rome, it would have been nearly
[02:40 --> 02:44] impossible for him to treat the question of succession with the same cavalier attitude
[02:44 --> 02:47] Trajan had displayed.
[02:47 --> 02:51] He had spent his life consolidating Rome's holdings and establishing peaceful relations
[02:51 --> 02:53] with potential external threats.
[02:53 --> 02:59] He did not want it all to be thrown away by some less enlightened successor.
[02:59 --> 03:03] He needed to think long and hard about who he was going to hand power to.
[03:03 --> 03:08] But it soon became apparent that the aging and very possibly dying emperor was not the
[03:08 --> 03:15] same eminently rational man who had ruled the empire for so long.
[03:15 --> 03:20] The ancient histories first point to the emperor's feud with Apollodorus of Damascus as proof
[03:20 --> 03:22] that he was beginning to lose his grip.
[03:22 --> 03:27] Hadrian, who always fancied himself an excellent architect, had designed a great temple of
[03:27 --> 03:32] Venus that was dedicated in Rome in 135.
[03:32 --> 03:36] Proud of what he considered a magnificent work of art, Hadrian asked the greatest architect
[03:36 --> 03:41] of his generation, Apollodorus, to comment on the design and construction.
[03:41 --> 03:46] Obviously fishing for compliment, Hadrian was deeply grieved when Apollodorus sent back
[03:46 --> 03:51] a stern critique of the building's foundation, the line of sight for visitors approaching
[03:51 --> 03:56] along the sacred way, the size of the doors, they were too small, and the size of the statue
[03:56 --> 03:59] of Venus inside, it was too large.
[03:59 --> 04:04] If Venus ever wished to go out for a stroll, Apollodorus caustically informed the emperor,
[04:04 --> 04:08] she would be unable to fit through the entryway.
[04:08 --> 04:12] Now the emperor and the architect had been on tense terms for years.
[04:12 --> 04:17] A standard legend has it that at some point during the Dacian Wars, Hadrian had interrupted
[04:17 --> 04:21] a conference between Trajan and Apollodorus to offer his own opinion of the project they
[04:21 --> 04:26] were discussing, and Apollodorus, incensed that this young amateur was even approaching
[04:26 --> 04:31] the grown-ups table, dismissed Hadrian, telling him to go back to his drawings, that he understood
[04:31 --> 04:34] none of this.
[04:34 --> 04:37] Relations between the enthusiastic amateur and the proud professional never got much
[04:37 --> 04:42] better, though Hadrian seems to have respected Apollodorus enough that he asked the architect
[04:42 --> 04:47] to help design war machines that would allow the legions to attack Jewish cave bases during
[04:47 --> 04:50] the Third Jewish War.
[04:50 --> 04:55] But respect or no, Cassius Dio reports that when Hadrian read Apollodorus's critique,
[04:55 --> 05:01] that he became enraged and ordered the architect banished from Rome, and shortly thereafter
[05:01 --> 05:03] had him executed.
[05:03 --> 05:08] If this seems like an overly rash response to what was probably reasonable criticism,
[05:08 --> 05:12] you're right, and most modern historians do not believe that Apollodorus was actually
[05:12 --> 05:18] killed by Hadrian, but that instead the old architect simply died of natural causes around
[05:18 --> 05:25] the time of the exchange, and that Hadrian's enemies drew their own libelous conclusions.
[05:25 --> 05:29] But if the crime itself never took place, the mood of Hadrian's last years certainly
[05:29 --> 05:34] made believing that the crime did take place easy to swallow, and that, more than anything
[05:34 --> 05:37] else, is the moral of the story.
[05:37 --> 05:41] Because while he may not have executed Apollodorus, the emperor's treatment of his own family
[05:41 --> 05:43] is confirmed fact.
[05:43 --> 05:48] Placing Apollodorus's blood on Hadrian's hands is not so much a matter of falsely accusing
[05:48 --> 05:54] the innocent, as it is adding one more name to the list.
[05:54 --> 06:00] As 135 gave way to 136, the issue of succession began to consume the emperor.
[06:00 --> 06:04] That and the completion of his great mausoleum on the banks of the Tiber, which is still
[06:04 --> 06:09] standing in Rome, so go visit that too.
[06:09 --> 06:13] For Neospidanius Fuscus, the only living male relative of the emperor, this should have
[06:13 --> 06:15] come as welcome news.
[06:15 --> 06:20] Fuscus was Hadrian's teenage great-nephew, the grandson of his sister and a powerful
[06:20 --> 06:24] senator named Lucius Julius Servianus.
[06:24 --> 06:28] But unfortunately for Fuscus, Hadrian had watched the boy grow up, and determined that
[06:28 --> 06:34] he was utterly unfit for power, that his tastes were too lavish and too petty, a Nero in the
[06:34 --> 06:37] making if there ever was one.
[06:37 --> 06:42] Hadrian's unwillingness to commit to Fuscus greatly annoyed his grandfather Servianus,
[06:42 --> 06:47] who was past ninety years old, but still growing strong.
[06:47 --> 06:51] Servianus and Hadrian had never gotten along, and the fact that they were brothers-in-law
[06:51 --> 06:55] seems only to have widened the gap rather than bridge it.
[06:55 --> 06:59] It certainly did not help that it had been widely reported Servianus's was one of the
[06:59 --> 07:04] few names Trajan had ever firmly put forward as a possible worthy heir to the throne back
[07:04 --> 07:08] in 116-117.
[07:08 --> 07:12] That he had been passed over in favor of his younger, cockier brother-in-law, likely through
[07:12 --> 07:17] the machinations of a woman at that, had always stuck in Servianus's craw.
[07:17 --> 07:22] But in his last years, the unmistakable reality that his grandson was the only man living
[07:22 --> 07:27] with a blood relation to the emperor seemed to Servianus to resemble some kind of cosmic
[07:27 --> 07:30] justice.
[07:30 --> 07:35] But in defiance of this cosmic justice, Hadrian determined that whoever he chose, young Fuscus
[07:35 --> 07:39] would not be his man, blood ties be damned.
[07:39 --> 07:44] This second passover of Servianus's family maybe, maybe would have gone without incident
[07:44 --> 07:49] Had Hadrian chosen as heir someone whose worth could not be denied by anyone, much as nervous
[07:49 --> 07:54] choice of Trajan had put to rest every other claim on power, even amongst those who really
[07:54 --> 07:58] thought they deserved the call.
[07:58 --> 08:03] Hadrian could have settled Servianus's discontent by choosing some worthy men, like for example,
[08:03 --> 08:08] and I'm just throwing this out there, Sextus Julius Severus, the troubleshooting general
[08:08 --> 08:11] who had just won the war in Judea.
[08:11 --> 08:16] But instead, in 136, prompted by a massive hemorrhage that nearly killed him, Hadrian
[08:16 --> 08:21] announced to a shocked Roman world that he was adopting a relatively obscure and unaccomplished
[08:21 --> 08:26] man named Lucius Caonius Commodus.
[08:26 --> 08:30] Muckriggers immediately pointed to Lucius's reputation as a pretty dilettante, as the
[08:30 --> 08:36] deciding factor, but the emperor's sympathizers argued that Hadrian was playing a game of
[08:36 --> 08:40] four dimensional chess with the succession issue that only the brilliant emperor himself
[08:40 --> 08:42] could fully understand.
[08:42 --> 08:47] I, of course, would adopt the boring conclusion that it was likely somewhere in between these
[08:47 --> 08:49] two extremes.
[08:49 --> 08:54] The choice of Lucius, who changed his name to Lucius Aelius Caesar when the adoption
[08:54 --> 08:59] went through, does seem a curious one taken on its own though.
[08:59 --> 09:03] Lucius was a capable enough senator, but he had well known health problems, likely suffering
[09:03 --> 09:05] from tuberculosis.
[09:05 --> 09:10] If Hadrian wanted to ensure the stability of the dynasty and the empire, choosing the
[09:10 --> 09:15] perpetually bedridden Lucius was an odd choice to say the least.
[09:15 --> 09:20] But like I say, it is entirely possible that Hadrian was looking beyond Lucius to the man
[09:20 --> 09:25] or men he really wanted to control the empire down the road.
[09:25 --> 09:30] Lucius would be his stopgap, his very own Nerva, to bridge the interregnum between
[09:30 --> 09:35] Hadrian and the young men he really had his eyes on.
[09:35 --> 09:39] But before we get into them, it is worth mentioning one other salient detail about
[09:39 --> 09:44] Lucius that may have recommended him to the emperor, namely that he was the son-in-law
[09:44 --> 09:50] of Publius Negrinus, one of the four ex-consuls who had been murdered in 118.
[09:50 --> 09:54] Hadrian was concerned about his legacy and the choice of Lucius may have been an olive
[09:54 --> 09:59] branch to the senate, an admission that he understood their anger and that he wanted
[09:59 --> 10:03] to set things right.
[10:03 --> 10:08] Let's agree, though, that Lucius was not the true object of the emperor's plans, that
[10:08 --> 10:13] the fourth dimension of Hadrian's scheme was the grandson of one of the emperor's closest
[10:13 --> 10:18] friends and advisors, Marcus Aeneas Verus.
[10:18 --> 10:23] Born with his father and grandfather's name, young Marcus Verus, then fifteen years old,
[10:23 --> 10:29] had caught the emperor's attention early as an unusually serious and intelligent boy.
[10:29 --> 10:34] Having been raised in part by his grandfather, who Hadrian held in the highest esteem, young
[10:34 --> 10:39] Marcus was marked from the beginning as one worth watching.
[10:39 --> 10:43] As the emperor watched Marcus grow up, he was impressed more and more with the studious
[10:43 --> 10:46] and capable teenager.
[10:46 --> 10:50] We'll get more into the biographical particulars of the man history will come to know as Marcus
[10:50 --> 10:55] Aurelius in our next episode, but I just want to note for now that upon Lucius's adoption
[10:56 --> 11:01] Marcus was engaged to Lucius's daughter almost immediately.
[11:01 --> 11:06] Though he had a son of his own, a six-year-old also named Lucius Caonius Commodus, Hadrian
[11:06 --> 11:11] seems to have been setting things up so that when the perpetually ill Lucius Caesar inevitably
[11:11 --> 11:16] succumbed to one of his many ailments, power would transfer naturally to his new son-in-law
[11:16 --> 11:18] Marcus.
[11:18 --> 11:23] This of course begs us to ask the question, why not just adopt Marcus straight away?
[11:23 --> 11:26] Why take the scenic route through Lucius?
[11:26 --> 11:30] The one obvious answer is that at fifteen, Marcus may have been a promising candidate
[11:30 --> 11:35] for power, but was not yet seasoned enough for Hadrian's tastes.
[11:35 --> 11:40] Nero and Caligula had proven the folly of allowing the young too much power.
[11:40 --> 11:45] Lucius, though weakly constituted, was still in the prime of his middle age and would likely
[11:45 --> 11:50] last long enough to at least get Marcus into his mid-twenties, at which point he would
[11:50 --> 11:54] hopefully have enough experience to temper the excesses of youth.
[11:54 --> 11:59] But who knows, maybe Hadrian was trying to have his cake and eat it too.
[11:59 --> 12:03] Adopt the son-in-law of Negrinus to appease the senate, knowing full well that Lucius would
[12:03 --> 12:10] die off quickly and Hadrian's real choice of heir could take over.
[12:10 --> 12:15] The choice of Lucius appears to have been too much for Servianus and Fuscus to take.
[12:15 --> 12:20] Fuscus especially saw the throne as his birthright and when he learned that he had been passed
[12:20 --> 12:25] over just as his grandfather had before him, the young man set himself on a plan to overthrow
[12:25 --> 12:30] the aging Hadrian and seize power for himself.
[12:30 --> 12:35] At some point in late 137, Hadrian's spy network informed him of the plot and the Emperor
[12:35 --> 12:38] took decisive action.
[12:38 --> 12:42] He seized young Fuscus, who was no doubt close at hand as he was still a member of the imperial
[12:42 --> 12:48] court, even if his relevance was now virtually non-existent.
[12:48 --> 12:52] During the brunt of the Emperor's wrath, the young alleged usurper was ordered to commit
[12:52 --> 12:54] suicide.
[12:54 --> 13:00] But the death of his great-nephew was apparently not enough and shortly after Fuscus's death,
[13:00 --> 13:06] Hadrian unexpectedly turned on Servianus and ordered him too to commit suicide.
[13:06 --> 13:10] The Roman elites could take in stride the political assassination of a young man who
[13:10 --> 13:15] was very possibly himself plotting political assassination, but forcing an old man to end
[13:16 --> 13:21] his life in such a dishonorable way, especially one who had spent that life nobly serving
[13:21 --> 13:24] the Empire, was a pointless outrage.
[13:24 --> 13:30] Servianus, as you can imagine, was himself outraged, but after firmly avowing his innocence
[13:30 --> 13:35] and his fidelity both to Rome and the Emperor, he did indeed kill himself.
[13:35 --> 13:40] But before he died, he swore one solemn, bitter prayer.
[13:40 --> 13:45] May Hadrian long for death, yet be unable to die.
[13:45 --> 13:50] It seems clear that the case against Servianus was trumped up and that Hadrian was finally
[13:50 --> 13:56] acting on a long-held grudge, but what are we to make of Fuscus's alleged coup plot?
[13:56 --> 14:00] For the Senate, it was not even a matter of debate.
[14:00 --> 14:04] Hadrian had invented charges against and then murdered his great-nephew to ensure that his
[14:04 --> 14:10] own diabolical plans for the future of Rome progressed unhindered.
[14:10 --> 14:14] Some sources claim that other men of senatorial rank were also caught up in Hadrian's paranoid
[14:14 --> 14:20] net and killed at the same time, implying that Hadrian had basically cooked up a wide-ranging
[14:20 --> 14:27] conspiracy so he could prosecute anyone who might trouble his plan for succession.
[14:27 --> 14:31] In the end, it's really hard to tell what's true and what's not, especially given the
[14:31 --> 14:34] Senate's clear enmity toward Hadrian.
[14:34 --> 14:38] But given the Emperor's mood at the time, it is possible that he did engage in a carefully
[14:38 --> 14:43] planned purge to clear the path for his chosen heirs, and perhaps deal a bit of vengeance
[14:43 --> 14:47] to his enemies before he died.
[14:47 --> 14:54] Some sources even have it that Hadrian's long-estranged wife Sabina was herself caught up in the purge.
[14:54 --> 14:59] Because however it happened, she died in early 137 and was thus easily lumped into stories
[14:59 --> 15:03] about the Emperor's mad reign of terror.
[15:03 --> 15:08] Rumor mongers breathlessly wondered, did he suspect that she would act as Pompeya had
[15:08 --> 15:13] when Trajan died and upset the apple-cart of his carefully laid plans?
[15:13 --> 15:14] Probably not.
[15:14 --> 15:19] Though they had never gotten along personally, Hadrian had always gone out of his way to
[15:19 --> 15:24] treat her, and make sure everyone else treated her, with great respect, and in turn she was
[15:24 --> 15:27] as loyal to the regime as anyone.
[15:27 --> 15:34] Like with Appledorus, coincidence is likely leading to conspiracy theory.
[15:34 --> 15:39] But if, after the deaths of Fuscus, Servianus, and whoever else, Hadrian thought his house
[15:40 --> 15:44] was well in order, he was in for a cruel shock.
[15:44 --> 15:49] Just a month after the executions, let's call them what they really were, his heir Lucius
[15:49 --> 15:53] Caesar returned from Pannonia where he had been sent by the Emperor to oversee the defense
[15:53 --> 15:56] of the Danube frontier for the year.
[15:56 --> 16:01] Though Lucius did an admirable job in ministering the region throughout 137, the climate had
[16:01 --> 16:06] taken its toll on the perpetually bed-ridden new Caesar.
[16:06 --> 16:10] Back in Rome, Lucius was preparing to address the Senate on New Year's Day when he became
[16:10 --> 16:13] seriously ill.
[16:13 --> 16:17] Some report that he overdosed on the medicine he had been prescribed, but whatever the cause,
[16:17 --> 16:24] on January 1, 138, Lucius Caesar died, sending Hadrian's perhaps too clever by half succession
[16:24 --> 16:28] plans into disarray.
[16:28 --> 16:32] The Senate breathed a sigh of relief that Lucius had not lived long enough to fall flat
[16:32 --> 16:36] on his face as Emperor, as they were all fairly sure he would, and hope rippled through
[16:36 --> 16:43] the aristocracy that Hadrian would come to his senses and choose a deserving candidate.
[16:43 --> 16:48] But dipping once again into the well of the handsome, yet undistinguished, on January
[16:48 --> 16:55] 22, 138 AD, Hadrian pulled out another random name to confound professional prognosticators.
[16:56 --> 17:03] Titus Aurelius Fulvius Boeionius Arius Antoninus was a well-liked senator who had traveled
[17:03 --> 17:08] up the cursus honorum with a sort of stable plotting, but he was just about the last man
[17:08 --> 17:12] anyone would have guessed Hadrian would adopt as his heir.
[17:12 --> 17:17] But the fates work in random ways, and Antoninus suddenly found himself next in line for the
[17:17 --> 17:18] throne.
[17:18 --> 17:24] This time, the choice would stick, and the man we all now know as Antoninus Pius will
[17:24 --> 17:31] soon find himself ruling Rome for the better part of twenty-three blessedly banal years.
[17:31 --> 17:37] Antoninus had been born in September of 86 AD, the son of Titus Aurelius Fulvius, who
[17:37 --> 17:41] would serve as consul under Domitian in 89.
[17:41 --> 17:45] The Fulvii branch of the Aurelians had emerged during the early imperial period as one of
[17:45 --> 17:49] the leading families of non-Italian origin.
[17:49 --> 17:53] But though they called southern Gaul their homeland, by Antoninus's time, the family
[17:53 --> 17:58] had emigrated to Italy, and Antoninus himself was born in Lavinium, about twenty miles
[17:58 --> 18:00] from Rome.
[18:00 --> 18:04] His grandfather had taken the family to the height of imperial favor during the crisis
[18:04 --> 18:11] of 69 AD, throughout which he commanded the third legion stationed along the Danube.
[18:11 --> 18:16] After initially fighting for Otho, he switched, along with the rest of his defeated comrades,
[18:16 --> 18:21] to Vespasian's banner, and so found himself seated alongside the Flavians when they finally
[18:21 --> 18:25] won that brutal game of musical chairs.
[18:25 --> 18:31] Rewarded for his service with a Suffet consulship at some point in the 70s AD, Domitian rewarded
[18:31 --> 18:35] him further with an ordinary consulship in 85.
[18:35 --> 18:41] Just four years later, his son, Antoninus's father, was similarly rewarded.
[18:41 --> 18:46] But both Antoninus's father and grandfather died sometime in the early 90s AD, and young
[18:46 --> 18:51] Antoninus, then still known by his birth name Titus Aurelius Fulvis, was taken under
[18:51 --> 18:57] the wing of his maternal grandfather, Neus Arius Antoninus, hence the addition of Arius
[18:57 --> 19:00] and Antoninus to the boy's name.
[19:00 --> 19:04] The elder Antoninus was a well-respected senator who counted amongst his friends plenty the
[19:04 --> 19:10] younger, and he brought up his grandson with the stable, if boring, values of a cultured
[19:10 --> 19:13] Roman aristocrat.
[19:13 --> 19:19] While in his early 20s, Antoninus married Ania Galeria Faustina, granddaughter of Hadrian's
[19:19 --> 19:23] aforementioned friend Marcus Aeneas Verus.
[19:23 --> 19:29] The pairing was obviously fortuitous for Antoninus, and when Hadrian became emperor in 117, the
[19:29 --> 19:33] young man found himself on the fringes of the imperial court by virtue of his relation
[19:33 --> 19:35] to Verus.
[19:35 --> 19:41] In 120, Antoninus was given a consulship, and, having obviously impressed Hadrian, he
[19:41 --> 19:46] was later chosen to be one of the four procurators who would govern Italy after Hadrian reformed
[19:46 --> 19:50] the administration of the peninsula in 127.
[19:50 --> 19:55] Long term, of course, his association with this wildly unpopular reform was something
[19:55 --> 19:59] of a black mark on his reputation, but for the time being, it was a signal of imperial
[19:59 --> 20:02] favor.
[20:02 --> 20:06] Antoninus was likely looking forward to a career of distinction and responsibility,
[20:06 --> 20:12] though it is unlikely he ever considered that he himself would be emperor one day.
[20:12 --> 20:17] But there he was in January of 138, suddenly called to the imperial villa and informed
[20:17 --> 20:23] that he could now add Caesar to his long list of names because the emperor, out of the blue,
[20:23 --> 20:26] was adopting him.
[20:26 --> 20:29] Once again, we must ask the question why.
[20:29 --> 20:31] Why Antoninus?
[20:31 --> 20:35] He was capable and trustworthy, sure, but like Lucius before him, there was nothing
[20:35 --> 20:40] really special to point to that said, oh yeah, you have to pick this guy Antoninus.
[20:40 --> 20:42] He's perfect for the job.
[20:42 --> 20:46] It is at this point, though, that we can really get into the guts of Hadrian's thinking, where
[20:46 --> 20:52] it becomes apparent that it was Marcus Aurelius Hadrian wanted all along.
[20:52 --> 20:57] Because when he offered Antoninus the job of emperor, a job that dying Hadrian assured
[20:57 --> 21:01] Antoninus would be his sooner rather than later, he stipulated that Antoninus had to
[21:01 --> 21:07] adopt both Marcus and the dead Lucius Caesar's son, Lucius Commodus, as his heirs, otherwise
[21:07 --> 21:09] the deal was off.
[21:09 --> 21:15] Clearly, Hadrian was thinking a generation ahead of everyone else.
[21:15 --> 21:20] Antoninus then was merely a dependable way to get from here to Marcus.
[21:20 --> 21:24] Already well into his fifties, Antoninus could be expected to die off sometime in the next
[21:24 --> 21:29] decade or so, giving Marcus time for a proper imperial apprenticeship before he donned the
[21:29 --> 21:33] purple for himself.
[21:33 --> 21:38] Antoninus begged a few days to consider the emperor's offer.
[21:38 --> 21:42] Though this humble podcast has been dealing primarily with the most ambitious Romans of
[21:42 --> 21:46] every generation, which may leave you all with the impression that lust for power was
[21:46 --> 21:52] the defining character trait of every man, woman, and child in the empire, not every
[21:52 --> 21:54] Roman dreamed imperial dreams.
[21:54 --> 21:59] The job was hard, dangerous, and all consuming.
[21:59 --> 22:03] Antoninus was genuinely unsure whether he wanted the gig.
[22:03 --> 22:08] He had a pretty good life, a happy marriage, a nice network of friends, and a healthy amount
[22:08 --> 22:10] of cash in the bank.
[22:10 --> 22:14] Was it really worth giving up the comfortable life of a cultured senator for the infinite
[22:14 --> 22:17] burdens of empire?
[22:17 --> 22:23] But the lure of power, or perhaps more likely the pressure from Hadrian, induced Antoninus
[22:23 --> 22:30] to accept the deal, and on February 25, 138 AD, he became Titus Aelius Caesar Antoninus,
[22:30 --> 22:35] heir to the imperial throne and adoptive father of a solemn teenager named Marcus and a precocious
[22:35 --> 22:40] adolescent boy named Lucius.
[22:40 --> 22:44] In recognition of the adoption, the senate invested Antoninus with tribunition power
[22:44 --> 22:49] and granted him full imperium, that is, power of life and death over the subjects of the
[22:49 --> 22:51] empire.
[22:51 --> 22:55] He did not have long to get up to speed on the full gamut of responsibilities weighing
[22:55 --> 22:59] down Hadrian's clearly slumping shoulders, and by the look of the emperor, the transfer
[22:59 --> 23:03] of power could come at any time.
[23:03 --> 23:07] Hadrian was suffering from what modern doctors have diagnosed as congestive heart disease
[23:07 --> 23:12] and his body filled painfully with fluid, forcing him to spend most of his final days
[23:12 --> 23:13] in bed.
[23:13 --> 23:18] In the end, Servianus's prayer came true, as the suffering emperor tried and failed
[23:18 --> 23:21] multiple times to kill himself.
[23:21 --> 23:25] He had daggers and poison smuggled into his room on no fewer than three occasions, only
[23:25 --> 23:31] to be thwarted at the last moment, and one attendant at least committed suicide rather
[23:31 --> 23:35] than disobey Hadrian's orders to kill him.
[23:35 --> 23:40] Antoninus himself finally intervened and begged Hadrian to bear his pain and let nature take
[23:40 --> 23:42] its course.
[23:42 --> 23:47] Hadrian's mood seems to have improved at least some following the intervention, and in letters
[23:47 --> 23:52] exchanged with his new adopted son, he apologizes for letting his grief take over.
[23:52 --> 23:57] A correspondence commenced that eventually resulted in Hadrian writing a full autobiography
[23:57 --> 24:02] so that the record would be straight and Antoninus would have the full story of the past 20 years
[24:02 --> 24:04] laid out in full.
[24:04 --> 24:10] Unfortunately, no record of the autobiography exists, though modern scholars suppose that
[24:10 --> 24:17] much of Hadrian's entry in the Historia Augusta was sourced to this autobiography.
[24:17 --> 24:23] Finally though, the black magic of Servianus's prayer wore off, and on July 10, 138 AD, attended
[24:23 --> 24:29] only by two slaves and Antoninus, Hadrian died at one of the imperial palaces in Campania
[24:29 --> 24:31] along the Bay of Naples.
[24:31 --> 24:39] He was 62 years old and had ruled Rome for 21 years.
[24:39 --> 24:43] Servianus is one of the most fascinating men in the history of Rome, but I will admit that
[24:43 --> 24:48] after a month of obsessing over him and trying to fit all of his contradictions and nuances
[24:48 --> 24:54] and accomplishments into my head, I'm suffering from a bit of Hadrian fatigue.
[24:54 --> 24:59] But in this, I kind of feel like I know the emperor as his contemporaries did.
[24:59 --> 25:03] He was, simply put, an exhausting man to deal with.
[25:03 --> 25:08] Eternally energetic, he was always traveling to some new city or starting some new project.
[25:09 --> 25:14] But the wisdom of his rule, which bordered on visionary, was accompanied by a know-it-all
[25:14 --> 25:19] pomposity that had to have driven everyone at least a little bit nuts.
[25:19 --> 25:24] No one likes a man who knows everything, especially when he shows up at your doorstep and starts
[25:24 --> 25:28] lecturing you on subjects you yourself are an expert in.
[25:28 --> 25:33] There is a funny story where the emperor and a celebrated philosopher engaged in a debate
[25:33 --> 25:38] where it was apparent to everyone that Hadrian's argument was far weaker.
[25:38 --> 25:42] To the surprise of the audience, though, the philosopher eventually gave in and acknowledged
[25:42 --> 25:45] the emperor had bested him.
[25:45 --> 25:49] After the event, the philosopher was pressed by his friends, who demanded to know why he
[25:49 --> 25:51] had given up so easily.
[25:51 --> 25:55] The philosopher simply reminded his friends that the emperor was the most learned man
[25:55 --> 25:57] of all.
[25:57 --> 26:01] Taken aback, the friends laughed at this obviously untrue statement.
[26:01 --> 26:03] But the philosopher insisted that it was true.
[26:03 --> 26:08] You should always remember, he said to them, the most learned man of all is the man who
[26:08 --> 26:11] commands thirty legions.
[26:11 --> 26:17] Hadrian was undeniably a great emperor, and very often a good man, but he was also a flawed
[26:17 --> 26:21] human being who could be an insufferably smug bully.
[26:21 --> 26:26] But he did bring the beard back into fashion, and for that alone he deserves all the praise
[26:26 --> 26:29] he gets.
[26:29 --> 26:31] There will be no episode next week.
[26:32 --> 26:35] Mr. and Mrs. The History of Rome are both celebrating birthdays and we're going to take
[26:35 --> 26:41] some time for ourselves, but we'll be back on February 28th to introduce the Antonines,
[26:41 --> 26:45] the last enlightened emperors of the Principate.
[26:45 --> 26:49] After their departure from the stage, Rome will not see rulers with half as much vision
[26:49 --> 26:54] until the rise of Diocletian, and by that point, Augustus' Principate will be dead
[26:54 --> 26:59] and a whole new political order will need to be created to sustain the battered empire.

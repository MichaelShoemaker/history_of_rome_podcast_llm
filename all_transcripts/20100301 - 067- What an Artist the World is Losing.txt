[00:04 --> 00:13] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 67, What an Artist the World is Losing.
[00:14 --> 00:19] Nero had dodged a bullet in 65 AD when the far-reaching Peasonian conspiracy was exposed
[00:19 --> 00:21] before it had a chance to act.
[00:22 --> 00:26] Thus far, Nero had been living his life with a sort of flippant disregard for
[00:26 --> 00:30] the aristocracy, obsessed about his standing with the masses, sure, but not really giving
[00:30 --> 00:33] a hoot what a bunch of crusty old senators thought about him.
[00:34 --> 00:38] But after the plot was discovered, Nero was exposed to a reality that he had never really
[00:38 --> 00:39] considered before.
[00:40 --> 00:44] Not only were powerful men unhappy with him, but they were willing to go to extreme
[00:44 --> 00:46] lengths to express their unhappiness.
[00:46 --> 00:50] And not only were they willing to go to extreme lengths to express their unhappiness,
[00:50 --> 00:54] but except for one lucky break, they had almost gone to them.
[00:54 --> 01:00] Nero suddenly realized that his reign, and his life, existed in a far more precarious
[01:00 --> 01:01] place than he had previously thought.
[01:02 --> 01:07] Now this is the point where a more introspective man, aided by wise counsel, might examine
[01:07 --> 01:12] the roots of the aristocracy's displeasure and wonder what he, Nero, might be able
[01:12 --> 01:14] to do to mute their anger.
[01:14 --> 01:17] Were there things he did that were unnecessarily inflammatory?
[01:18 --> 01:22] And that, if he knocked off the more extreme stuff, maybe he could avoid perpetually
[01:22 --> 01:24] dealing with plots against his life?
[01:25 --> 01:29] But Nero was not an introspective man, and his counsel was not wise.
[01:30 --> 01:34] So rather than repent his extravagances and grow up a little, he decided to dig
[01:34 --> 01:35] in his heels.
[01:35 --> 01:39] And if anyone didn't like it, well, there were always treason trials for the
[01:39 --> 01:39] incorrigible.
[01:40 --> 01:45] But as is so often the case, show trials and indiscriminate persecutions create
[01:45 --> 01:50] far more enemies than they destroy, and in a few short years, Nero will reap the
[01:50 --> 01:51] full blowback for his actions.
[01:54 --> 01:59] 65 was not just a bad year for Nero because it was very nearly his last, but also because
[01:59 --> 02:04] his wife, Papia, mother of his daughter and pregnant with his second, died during
[02:04 --> 02:04] the summer.
[02:05 --> 02:09] There are conflicting reports about her death, with some surmising that Papia died
[02:09 --> 02:12] naturally during childbirth, as often occurred in the ancient world.
[02:13 --> 02:18] But of course, the more famous and salacious version offered by Suetonius and Tacitus
[02:18 --> 02:22] is that, over the course of an argument, Nero became enraged and repeatedly kicked
[02:22 --> 02:26] her in the stomach until she and the unborn child were dead.
[02:27 --> 02:32] Whichever way it occurred, Nero became almost insane with grief, or remorse depending
[02:32 --> 02:33] on the version of the story you believe.
[02:34 --> 02:38] And rather than cremating Papia, he had her stuffed and embalmed so that he could
[02:38 --> 02:40] visit her in the imperial mausoleum.
[02:41 --> 02:45] In the years after her death, Nero would delve even deeper into his singing, acting
[02:45 --> 02:51] and chariot racing career, culminating in 67 with his participation in the Olympic
[02:51 --> 02:52] Games.
[02:53 --> 02:57] Despite being thrown and nearly dying from a ten-horse chariot and delivering amateurist
[02:57 --> 03:02] singing and acting performances, Nero won the victory crowns for every competition
[03:02 --> 03:02] he entered.
[03:03 --> 03:05] It was still good to be the king.
[03:06 --> 03:10] While Nero was off pretending to be some great entertainer, in the Far East the
[03:10 --> 03:14] Romans became embroiled in what would prove to be the first of several major
[03:14 --> 03:17] revolts in the combustible province of Judea.
[03:18 --> 03:22] That the first of these is known simply as the Great Revolt is all you need to know
[03:22 --> 03:25] about the impact the conflict will have on the history of the world.
[03:26 --> 03:29] We won't be able to finish the whole thing today as in between the beginning
[03:29 --> 03:34] and the end of it the whole year of the four emperors things happen, but we can
[03:34 --> 03:36] at least get it started along its way.
[03:37 --> 03:41] Trouble had been brewing in Judea from the moment the Romans first showed up in
[03:41 --> 03:41] the region.
[03:42 --> 03:45] Pompey the Great had famously entered the Holy of Holies in the Temple of
[03:45 --> 03:49] Jerusalem over the vehement protests of the high priest, which pretty much got
[03:49 --> 03:51] the Romans and Jews off on the wrong foot.
[03:52 --> 03:56] A short-lived revolt had broken out in the middle of Augustus' reign and of
[03:56 --> 04:00] course Caligula had nearly sparked a revolution when he insisted on having
[04:00 --> 04:02] a statue of himself placed in the temple.
[04:03 --> 04:06] But Judea remained relatively calm following the death of Caligula as
[04:06 --> 04:10] Claudius had done his best to walk the fine line between Roman
[04:10 --> 04:11] administration and Jewish autonomy.
[04:13 --> 04:17] But when Nero arrived on the scene he was far less attentive to that line and
[04:17 --> 04:21] Jewish complaints about Roman rule began to grow, culminating finally in
[04:21 --> 04:24] what is known as the Great Revolt or the First Roman Jewish War.
[04:26 --> 04:30] The list of grievances ticked off by the Jews usually included a host of
[04:30 --> 04:34] religious issues, but as much as conflicts between the monotheistic Jews
[04:34 --> 04:38] and polytheistic Romans antagonized both parties, at the heart of the
[04:38 --> 04:42] Great Revolt was something far more basic, tax policy.
[04:44 --> 04:47] Despite their persistent attempts to move away from the system, the Romans
[04:47 --> 04:51] continued to rely on tax farming in Judea and so dealt with the
[04:51 --> 04:53] inherent problems that the system introduced.
[04:54 --> 04:57] And just to recap, remember that a private collector would bid for the
[04:57 --> 05:01] amount of tax Rome required and then anything they brought in above that
[05:01 --> 05:02] quota was the collector's profit.
[05:03 --> 05:07] Local upper and middle-class urban Jews began to work these tax
[05:07 --> 05:10] farming contracts and in the eyes of the rural population and the
[05:10 --> 05:14] lower-class laborers began to shore the sheep a little too close to the
[05:14 --> 05:16] skin in an attempt to maximize their profits.
[05:18 --> 05:21] I bring this up only to note that with everything that happened at the
[05:21 --> 05:24] outbreak of the revolt and beyond, I think it's fair to say that as
[05:24 --> 05:28] much as the unrest was a Jewish revolt against foreign occupiers, it
[05:28 --> 05:32] was also a civil war within the Jewish community itself between those
[05:32 --> 05:35] who were profiting from the existing political structure and those
[05:35 --> 05:36] who were not.
[05:38 --> 05:41] One of the other important things to note about why the revolt broke out
[05:41 --> 05:45] in 66 and not some other year is that according to Josephus, the
[05:45 --> 05:49] complete rebuild and expansion of the Temple of Jerusalem begun by
[05:49 --> 05:54] Herod the Great was finally completed in 63 AD, which immediately left
[05:54 --> 05:57] thousands of poor laborers and middle-class artisans out of work.
[05:58 --> 06:02] And basically, any time you have thousands of young men out of work
[06:02 --> 06:05] concentrated in a city center, you are going to have problems.
[06:06 --> 06:09] It took a couple of years scraping by while continuing to be gouged
[06:09 --> 06:12] by the Roman collaborating tax farmers for these men to reach
[06:12 --> 06:17] their boiling point, but when they did, boy, did they ever boil over.
[06:18 --> 06:23] They finally passed from 99 to 100 degrees Celsius in 66 when the
[06:23 --> 06:26] Roman governor decided he was running low on funds, the
[06:26 --> 06:29] imperial treasury having been systematically drained by Nero, and
[06:29 --> 06:32] decided to simply confiscate all the money the high priest had
[06:32 --> 06:34] accumulated in the great temple.
[06:35 --> 06:38] When word got out that the high priest had allowed the Romans to
[06:38 --> 06:40] have the money, which had been collected from the masses above
[06:40 --> 06:44] and beyond the taxes they had already paid to Rome, well, that
[06:44 --> 06:45] just about does it, don't you think?
[06:47 --> 06:51] In August of 66 AD, an armed insurrection seized control of the
[06:51 --> 06:52] Roman stronghold at Masada.
[06:53 --> 06:56] The men who took Masada were members of a splinter group of the
[06:56 --> 06:59] radical sect of Judaism, the Zealots.
[07:00 --> 07:04] These radicals, known as the Sicarii, which is Latin for
[07:04 --> 07:07] daggers, were uncompromisingly militant and planned to settle
[07:07 --> 07:10] for nothing less than the expulsion of the Romans from
[07:10 --> 07:11] Judea.
[07:12 --> 07:15] From their new base in Masada, this group of Sicarii headed
[07:15 --> 07:18] north to Jerusalem, where they confronted the high priest who
[07:18 --> 07:21] they believed to be a corrupt Roman collaborator.
[07:21 --> 07:24] In the confrontation that followed, the high priest was
[07:25 --> 07:28] and in retaliation, the leader of the Sicarii himself was
[07:28 --> 07:31] assassinated, but this was only the beginning.
[07:32 --> 07:34] As August gave way to September, the small Roman
[07:34 --> 07:37] garrison in Jerusalem was besieged, forced to surrender,
[07:37 --> 07:39] and then hanged by an angry mob.
[07:40 --> 07:43] With the Roman military presence wiped out, Jerusalem
[07:43 --> 07:45] became an increasingly dangerous place for Greco
[07:45 --> 07:46] Romans of all types.
[07:47 --> 07:50] Not only were citizens of Rome targeted, but also any
[07:50 --> 07:52] Greek-speaking foreigner who had made the unfortunate
[07:52 --> 07:54] decision to settle in the city.
[07:55 --> 07:58] And once the foreigners had all been purged, the mobs turned
[07:58 --> 08:01] on Jews identified as collaborators with the Roman
[08:01 --> 08:01] regime.
[08:03 --> 08:05] When word came north that the garrison in Jerusalem had
[08:05 --> 08:08] all been murdered, the legate of Syria took a legion
[08:08 --> 08:11] south into Judea to restore order.
[08:11 --> 08:15] But in November 66, the revolting Jews shocked the
[08:15 --> 08:17] Romans by ambushing the invading legion at the pass
[08:17 --> 08:21] at Beth Horan and not only wiping the Romans out, but
[08:21 --> 08:23] also capturing their legionary eagle in the process.
[08:25 --> 08:27] The victory would prove to be a mixed blessing for the
[08:27 --> 08:30] Zealots as it simultaneously convinced them that Rome
[08:30 --> 08:33] could be beaten, while at the same time raising Roman
[08:33 --> 08:35] ire to the point that they were done taking the
[08:35 --> 08:39] insurrection lightly, which basically guaranteed that it
[08:39 --> 08:40] was going to be crushed.
[08:41 --> 08:44] Plans for a Roman response were escalated all the
[08:44 --> 08:47] way to the imperial court, and in late 66, Nero
[08:47 --> 08:50] appointed the general Vespasian to take command of
[08:50 --> 08:52] situation in the east and do what was necessary to
[08:52 --> 08:54] reassert Rome's dominance in Judea.
[08:58 --> 09:02] Titus Flavius Vespasianus was born in 17 AD in central
[09:02 --> 09:04] Italy and entered public life for the first time in
[09:04 --> 09:08] 36, when he was elected military tribune in Thrace
[09:08 --> 09:09] at the age of 19.
[09:10 --> 09:12] His father was of equestrian rank and his mother was
[09:12 --> 09:15] the sister of a senator, so Vespasian was fast
[09:15 --> 09:19] tracked up the Cursus honorum, and by 40 he had
[09:19 --> 09:22] already served a quaestor ship, an aedile ship, and
[09:22 --> 09:22] a praetor ship.
[09:24 --> 09:28] He married in 38 AD and had two sons, Titus born in 41
[09:28 --> 09:31] and Domitian born 10 years later in 51.
[09:32 --> 09:35] The father and two sons would each eventually sit on
[09:35 --> 09:38] the imperial throne, and collectively their so-called
[09:38 --> 09:42] Flavian dynasty would rule Rome from 69 to 96 AD,
[09:43 --> 09:45] providing the critical bridge between an empire ruled by
[09:45 --> 09:48] members of the Julio-Claudian family, and an
[09:48 --> 09:50] empire ruled by whichever man was strong enough,
[09:51 --> 09:54] smart enough, and savvy enough to hold on to power.
[09:56 --> 09:59] When Claudius ascended to the throne, Vespasian was
[09:59 --> 10:01] able to swing a friendly relationship with
[10:01 --> 10:04] Narcissus into an appointment as a legate in
[10:04 --> 10:07] Germania, and then a leading role in the invasion
[10:07 --> 10:08] of Britain a few years later.
[10:10 --> 10:12] Tasked with subduing the southern coast of the
[10:12 --> 10:15] island after the initial invasion, Vespasian was so
[10:15 --> 10:17] successful that he was awarded the right to wear
[10:17 --> 10:19] triumphal regalia in public.
[10:19 --> 10:21] The triumphal march itself was now reserved
[10:21 --> 10:23] exclusively for the emperor.
[10:24 --> 10:27] In 51 AD, he capped his public career off with a
[10:27 --> 10:28] brief consulship.
[10:28 --> 10:31] Though he was still young, Vespasian had achieved
[10:31 --> 10:33] everything an ambitious man in Rome could have ever
[10:33 --> 10:35] hoped for, so when his consulship was up, he
[10:35 --> 10:37] retired from public life.
[10:38 --> 10:41] But in 63, he was coaxed out of retirement by Nero,
[10:41 --> 10:43] an appointed governor of the province of Africa.
[10:44 --> 10:47] Reports conflict about whether his administration was
[10:47 --> 10:50] loved or hated by the locals, but at the very
[10:50 --> 10:52] least, it is agreed that Vespasian did not take the
[10:52 --> 10:55] opportunity to extort a personal fortune for
[10:55 --> 10:57] himself, as was usually the case with pro consul or
[10:57 --> 11:00] appointments, despite the constant regulatory
[11:00 --> 11:02] reforms that were introduced every few years
[11:02 --> 11:03] to discourage the practice.
[11:04 --> 11:06] Vespasian instead focused on building a strong
[11:06 --> 11:09] social network of clients and allies, and
[11:09 --> 11:11] though we don't know if it was necessarily on his
[11:11 --> 11:14] time, these allies will prove to be invaluable when
[11:14 --> 11:17] he makes his move for the imperial throne just a few
[11:17 --> 11:17] years later.
[11:19 --> 11:22] When he was recalled from Africa, Vespasian joined
[11:22 --> 11:25] Nero's imperial entourage to Greece, and it was
[11:25 --> 11:27] here that the thus far uniformly successful
[11:27 --> 11:29] career of Vespasian hit a snag.
[11:31 --> 11:33] Apparently, during one of Nero's numerous liar
[11:33 --> 11:36] performances, Vespasian had paid, quote,
[11:36 --> 11:39] insufficient attention to the performance, read,
[11:39 --> 11:42] he fell asleep, and immediately lost the
[11:42 --> 11:44] emperor's favor, which made Vespasian a
[11:44 --> 11:45] political non-entity.
[11:47 --> 11:49] It speaks volumes then about the esteem that he
[11:49 --> 11:51] was held in, that ultimately, when the crisis
[11:51 --> 11:54] of Judea broke out and things started to go
[11:54 --> 11:56] poorly for the Romans, that Nero turned back to
[11:56 --> 11:59] the man he had so recently declared persona
[11:59 --> 11:59] non grata.
[12:00 --> 12:03] In other words, Vespasian's grave crime of
[12:03 --> 12:05] dozing off could not outweigh the fact that
[12:05 --> 12:07] he was simply the best man for the job.
[12:09 --> 12:12] In April of 67, Vespasian arrived in
[12:12 --> 12:15] Ptolemaeus, a Judean port on the Mediterranean
[12:15 --> 12:17] coast, with two legions, and was shortly
[12:17 --> 12:19] thereafter joined by a legion led by his
[12:19 --> 12:21] eldest son Titus.
[12:21 --> 12:23] Coupled with the force led by the Roman
[12:23 --> 12:25] client King Agrippa II and other auxiliary
[12:25 --> 12:28] forces, the army led by Vespasian soon
[12:28 --> 12:30] numbered some 60,000.
[12:30 --> 12:33] The Roman general set about systematically
[12:33 --> 12:35] subduing the northern half of the province,
[12:35 --> 12:37] accepting the surrender of towns that were so
[12:37 --> 12:39] inclined, and annihilating towns that refused.
[12:40 --> 12:44] By early 68, he held the north, and from his
[12:44 --> 12:46] base in the port city of Caesarea, began to
[12:46 --> 12:48] sweep south along the coast.
[12:49 --> 12:51] His task was made easier by the fact that
[12:51 --> 12:54] the Jewish resistance was internally fractured.
[12:54 --> 12:56] Not counting the leaders who wanted no part of
[12:56 --> 12:58] the war with Rome to begin with, there were
[12:58 --> 13:00] resistance leaders who counseled for opening
[13:00 --> 13:03] talks with the Romans immediately, resistance
[13:03 --> 13:05] leaders who counseled holding out, but only
[13:05 --> 13:08] to a certain point, and resistance leaders,
[13:08 --> 13:10] among the zealots especially, who thought that
[13:10 --> 13:12] any talk of surrender was proof that you were
[13:12 --> 13:14] in league with the Romans and probably ought
[13:14 --> 13:15] to just be killed.
[13:16 --> 13:18] All these leaders wound up fleeing to
[13:18 --> 13:20] Jerusalem throughout the year, where they all
[13:20 --> 13:22] hold up together behind the reasonably sturdy
[13:22 --> 13:24] walls of the city where they planned to make
[13:24 --> 13:25] their stand.
[13:26 --> 13:28] Vespasian and his son Titus prepared to lay
[13:28 --> 13:31] siege to the city from three sides when an
[13:31 --> 13:33] unexpected piece of news came that stopped
[13:33 --> 13:35] Vespasian in his tracks.
[13:36 --> 13:38] Couriers arrived from Rome with a note, Nero
[13:38 --> 13:41] has committed suicide and Galba has been
[13:41 --> 13:42] declared Caesar.
[13:43 --> 13:43] Interesting.
[13:45 --> 13:47] Wrapped up as he was in the far east of the
[13:47 --> 13:49] empire, Vespasian could not have hoped to
[13:49 --> 13:51] keep up with the daily politicking in the
[13:51 --> 13:53] west, and when, in a matter of few months,
[13:53 --> 13:55] Nero went from undisputed ruler of the
[13:55 --> 13:58] greatest empire on earth to quivering child,
[13:58 --> 14:00] Vespasian was shocked, but probably not
[14:00 --> 14:02] surprised, if that makes sense.
[14:04 --> 14:06] The great revolt in Judea will continue for
[14:06 --> 14:08] another few years, but as the next important
[14:08 --> 14:10] event in the struggle, the sack of Jerusalem,
[14:11 --> 14:13] does not occur for another 18 whole months,
[14:13 --> 14:15] I'm going to have to return to it after
[14:15 --> 14:17] the yet to be determined number of
[14:17 --> 14:18] episodes I'll need to get through just the
[14:18 --> 14:20] single year of 69 AD.
[14:21 --> 14:23] So before we can keep going with the
[14:23 --> 14:24] great revolt, we're going to have to
[14:24 --> 14:26] backtrack a little and figure out what led
[14:26 --> 14:29] to the shocking note that Nero had
[14:29 --> 14:30] committed suicide.
[14:32 --> 14:34] As I said, Nero's erratic behavior was
[14:34 --> 14:36] getting really, really old.
[14:37 --> 14:39] He was neglecting his official duties,
[14:39 --> 14:40] spending all of his time at chariot
[14:40 --> 14:42] races, and bankrupting the empire in
[14:42 --> 14:43] the process.
[14:44 --> 14:46] Not only that, he had initiated his own
[14:46 --> 14:48] little reign of terror, and the
[14:48 --> 14:49] senators and generals who made up the
[14:49 --> 14:51] backbone of the imperial aristocracy,
[14:51 --> 14:53] all lived in fear of winding up on
[14:53 --> 14:54] Nero's hit list.
[14:55 --> 14:57] No less a figure than Corbulo, hero of
[14:57 --> 14:59] the war in Armenia, had been ordered to
[14:59 --> 15:01] commit suicide in 67 AD.
[15:02 --> 15:04] It was only a matter of time really
[15:04 --> 15:06] before Nero paid the price for his
[15:06 --> 15:07] fear inducing extravagances.
[15:10 --> 15:12] In March of 68, a governor of one of
[15:12 --> 15:14] the Gallic provinces, Gaius Julius
[15:14 --> 15:16] Vindex, had finally had enough.
[15:17 --> 15:18] Yet another set of orders had come
[15:18 --> 15:20] down, ratcheting up the tax levies to
[15:20 --> 15:22] help pay for Nero's total lack of
[15:22 --> 15:23] fiscal responsibility.
[15:24 --> 15:26] Vindex was a Roman all the way, but
[15:26 --> 15:27] he couldn't help but feel for the
[15:27 --> 15:29] local Gauls who were being taxed to the
[15:29 --> 15:30] breaking point.
[15:31 --> 15:33] He heard complaint after complaint from
[15:33 --> 15:34] his subjects that things couldn't go
[15:34 --> 15:36] on like this, and taking a look
[15:36 --> 15:38] around, he believed them.
[15:39 --> 15:41] The empire hadn't grown as large as
[15:41 --> 15:43] it had, or as strong as it had, by
[15:43 --> 15:45] breaking the backs of those that
[15:45 --> 15:45] supported it.
[15:46 --> 15:48] Vindex decided that Nero and the
[15:48 --> 15:50] health of the empire were two ideas
[15:50 --> 15:52] that were now mutually exclusive.
[15:53 --> 15:55] But surprisingly, when Vindex declared
[15:55 --> 15:57] in March that he was no longer taking
[15:57 --> 15:59] orders from the emperor, he also declared
[15:59 --> 16:01] that he himself was not looking to
[16:01 --> 16:02] become the emperor.
[16:03 --> 16:05] Instead, he announced that should
[16:05 --> 16:07] Servius Sulpicius Galba, the wise and
[16:07 --> 16:10] capable governor of Spain, rise to the
[16:10 --> 16:12] occasion that Vindex would back him.
[16:13 --> 16:15] But Galba was noncommittal, and
[16:15 --> 16:17] Vindex was left hanging in Gaul by
[16:17 --> 16:17] himself.
[16:18 --> 16:20] Nero ordered the governor of upper
[16:20 --> 16:22] Germany, Lucius Virginius Rufus, to
[16:22 --> 16:25] crush Vindex, and in short order, the
[16:25 --> 16:27] stronger and more capable Virginius did
[16:27 --> 16:29] just that, routing Vindex after a short
[16:29 --> 16:30] and decisive battle.
[16:31 --> 16:33] Vindex committed suicide to avoid
[16:33 --> 16:35] capture, but his dream of dislodging
[16:35 --> 16:37] Nero did not die with him.
[16:38 --> 16:39] In the glow of victory,
[16:39 --> 16:41] Virginius' troops did something
[16:41 --> 16:41] unexpected.
[16:42 --> 16:43] They declared their general
[16:43 --> 16:45] imperator and swore to follow him
[16:45 --> 16:47] if he decided to turn on Nero.
[16:48 --> 16:50] But Virginius refused to betray the
[16:50 --> 16:50] emperor.
[16:51 --> 16:53] In the end, despite having now allied
[16:53 --> 16:55] himself with Nero, Virginius managed to
[16:55 --> 16:57] escape the chaos of the year of the four
[16:57 --> 16:59] emperors and slip away unnoticed to
[16:59 --> 17:01] live another 30 years in quiet
[17:01 --> 17:02] anonymity.
[17:02 --> 17:03] Good for him.
[17:05 --> 17:07] Back in Rome, Nero watched all of this
[17:07 --> 17:08] unfold with horror, and even though
[17:08 --> 17:10] Galba had not joined in Vindex's
[17:10 --> 17:12] revolt, it was clear that the old
[17:12 --> 17:14] general was a rallying point for the
[17:14 --> 17:16] emperor's enemies, so he declared
[17:16 --> 17:17] Galba an enemy of the state and
[17:17 --> 17:18] ordered him arrested.
[17:19 --> 17:21] But this proved to be a
[17:21 --> 17:22] fatal miscalculation.
[17:22 --> 17:24] Galba had been wavering back and
[17:24 --> 17:26] forth on whether or not to be the man
[17:26 --> 17:28] so many seemed to want him to be.
[17:29 --> 17:29] But when he got the
[17:29 --> 17:31] notice that Nero had declared him an
[17:31 --> 17:33] enemy of the state, well, that really
[17:33 --> 17:35] helped make up his mind, didn't it?
[17:35 --> 17:37] When the arrest warrant for Galba was
[17:37 --> 17:39] announced, things quickly got out of
[17:39 --> 17:39] hand for Nero.
[17:40 --> 17:40] One of the
[17:40 --> 17:42] praetorian prefects, Gaius
[17:42 --> 17:44] Nymphidius Sabinus, declared his
[17:44 --> 17:46] intention to follow Galba as civil
[17:46 --> 17:47] war broke out.
[17:47 --> 17:49] With a large chunk of the
[17:49 --> 17:50] guard following their leader, Nero
[17:50 --> 17:52] suddenly realized that he was an
[17:52 --> 17:52] enemy of the state, and he was
[17:52 --> 17:53] in a very tight spot.
[17:54 --> 17:56] Afraid for his life, that happens
[17:56 --> 17:58] when your bodyguards start hinting
[17:58 --> 17:59] that they too would like to see you
[17:59 --> 18:01] dead, Nero fled down the road to the
[18:01 --> 18:03] port of Ostia, where he hoped to lead
[18:03 --> 18:04] a fleet east and regroup.
[18:05 --> 18:06] But the
[18:06 --> 18:07] soldiers at the pier could tell
[18:07 --> 18:08] which way the wind was blowing,
[18:08 --> 18:10] and they refused to obey Nero's
[18:10 --> 18:12] orders, taunting him with a line
[18:12 --> 18:14] from the Aeneid, is it so dreadful
[18:14 --> 18:15] a thing to die?
[18:16 --> 18:18] Really really spooked now, Nero
[18:18 --> 18:20] returned to Rome and tried to figure
[18:20 --> 18:21] out how in the hell he was going to
[18:21 --> 18:22] get out of this alive.
[18:23 --> 18:25] He considered throwing himself at
[18:25 --> 18:27] Galba's feet and begging for mercy.
[18:27 --> 18:28] Then he considered throwing
[18:28 --> 18:30] himself at the people's feet and
[18:30 --> 18:32] begging them for mercy, but rejected
[18:32 --> 18:34] both of those ideas as likely to lead
[18:34 --> 18:36] to his swift execution, so he then
[18:36 --> 18:38] considered fleeing east and asking
[18:38 --> 18:40] the Parthian king for asylum, but
[18:40 --> 18:42] realized that that too was a
[18:42 --> 18:44] ridiculous idea that would never work.
[18:46 --> 18:47] He tried to sleep on it in the
[18:47 --> 18:49] palace, but woke up around midnight,
[18:49 --> 18:51] and realized that the guard had all
[18:51 --> 18:52] deserted their posts.
[18:53 --> 18:55] Scared out of his wits, he searched
[18:55 --> 18:57] the rooms of his friends, but found
[18:57 --> 18:58] them all empty as well.
[18:59 --> 19:00] Nero had been deserted.
[19:02 --> 19:03] Recognizing that there was no
[19:03 --> 19:04] version of this story that ended
[19:04 --> 19:06] well, Nero called out for a slave
[19:06 --> 19:08] or a gladiator or anyone to kill
[19:08 --> 19:11] him, but no one answered, prompting
[19:11 --> 19:13] Nero to exclaim, have I neither
[19:13 --> 19:15] friend nor foe?
[19:15 --> 19:17] No one answered him, but I can
[19:17 --> 19:18] answer.
[19:18 --> 19:20] Nero may have had no friends, but
[19:20 --> 19:22] he was certainly not wanting for
[19:23 --> 19:23] foes.
[19:24 --> 19:25] Finally, Nero was able to connect
[19:25 --> 19:27] with a freedman who agreed to hide
[19:27 --> 19:28] the frightened emperor in a villa
[19:28 --> 19:30] four miles outside of Rome.
[19:31 --> 19:32] Accompanied by a few slaves, a
[19:32 --> 19:34] disguised Nero slipped out of the
[19:34 --> 19:35] palace and made his way through
[19:35 --> 19:37] the gates of the city undetected.
[19:38 --> 19:39] Upon his arrival at the villa,
[19:40 --> 19:41] he ordered the slaves to begin
[19:41 --> 19:43] digging a grave, and allegedly kept
[19:43 --> 19:45] repeating over and over again, what
[19:45 --> 19:47] an artist the world is losing.
[19:48 --> 19:50] At some point, a courier arrived
[19:50 --> 19:52] and delivered the news that Nero
[19:52 --> 19:53] had been dreading.
[19:53 --> 19:54] The Senate had met in an
[19:54 --> 19:56] emergency session, declared him a
[19:56 --> 19:58] public enemy, and announced that
[19:58 --> 20:00] if found, Nero was to be beaten
[20:00 --> 20:01] to death.
[20:02 --> 20:03] He tried to kill himself to
[20:03 --> 20:05] avoid capture, but kept losing
[20:05 --> 20:05] his nerve.
[20:06 --> 20:08] When the sound of approaching
[20:08 --> 20:09] horses began to cut through the
[20:09 --> 20:11] night though, Nero was able to
[20:11 --> 20:12] focus, and before the soldiers
[20:12 --> 20:14] arrived to collect him, Nero
[20:14 --> 20:15] stabbed himself in the throat.
[20:16 --> 20:18] When the detachment arrived, they
[20:18 --> 20:19] tried to stop the bleeding so
[20:19 --> 20:21] Rome could extract the full
[20:21 --> 20:22] measure of its vengeance, but
[20:22 --> 20:24] Nero was too far gone.
[20:25 --> 20:26] As they worked on the wound,
[20:26 --> 20:28] he whispered, too late, this
[20:28 --> 20:29] is fidelity.
[20:31 --> 20:33] Nero died on June 9th, 68 AD at
[20:33 --> 20:34] the age of 30.
[20:34 --> 20:37] He had ruled Rome for 14 years.
[20:39 --> 20:40] The death of Nero marked the
[20:40 --> 20:41] end of the Julio-Claudian
[20:41 --> 20:43] dynasty, and would usher in a
[20:43 --> 20:44] brief period of chaotic
[20:44 --> 20:46] uncertainty known as the year
[20:46 --> 20:48] of the four emperors, which
[20:48 --> 20:49] we'll start to get into fully
[20:49 --> 20:50] next week.
[20:51 --> 20:52] The question on the tip of
[20:52 --> 20:54] everyone's tongue was, now
[20:54 --> 20:55] that there was no Julio-Claudians
[20:55 --> 20:57] left, how would legitimacy be
[20:57 --> 20:59] conferred upon future emperors?
[21:00 --> 21:01] Augustus had been able to
[21:01 --> 21:03] establish and maintain imperial
[21:03 --> 21:04] authority initially through his
[21:04 --> 21:06] own personal brand of ruthless
[21:06 --> 21:08] charisma, and the fact that
[21:08 --> 21:09] his reign just kept going,
[21:09 --> 21:12] and going, and going, so that
[21:12 --> 21:13] by the time he died, it seemed
[21:13 --> 21:15] natural that his declared heir
[21:15 --> 21:16] Tiberius ought to rule.
[21:17 --> 21:19] From there, it had just been an
[21:19 --> 21:20] unbroken line of inheritance
[21:20 --> 21:21] all the way down to Nero.
[21:22 --> 21:24] But now that that line of
[21:24 --> 21:26] inheritance was broken, well,
[21:26 --> 21:27] what did that mean?
[21:27 --> 21:29] It was like Rome was waking up
[21:29 --> 21:30] after being hypnotized.
[21:30 --> 21:32] Suddenly, everyone was looking
[21:32 --> 21:34] at everyone else, blinking,
[21:34 --> 21:36] and wondering what to do now
[21:36 --> 21:37] that the Julio-Claudian spell
[21:37 --> 21:38] had been broken.
[21:39 --> 21:41] Nero had died with no heir,
[21:41 --> 21:42] and there was no mechanism to
[21:42 --> 21:43] determine which of the dozens
[21:43 --> 21:45] of highly ambitious men ought to
[21:45 --> 21:48] rule, nor any way to tell whether
[21:48 --> 21:49] or not the masses would accept
[21:49 --> 21:50] someone from outside the House
[21:50 --> 21:52] of Caesar as their master.
[21:53 --> 21:54] Or how about this?
[21:54 --> 21:56] Maybe the Julio-Claudian period
[21:56 --> 21:58] will prove to be a historical
[21:58 --> 21:58] aberration.
[21:59 --> 22:00] Maybe Rome can return to its
[22:00 --> 22:01] Republican roots.
[22:02 --> 22:03] There was no shortage of
[22:03 --> 22:05] questions, and no shortage of
[22:05 --> 22:06] ambitious men who claimed to
[22:06 --> 22:07] have the answer.
[22:08 --> 22:09] Next week, we'll try to lay
[22:09 --> 22:11] the foundation for the seminal
[22:11 --> 22:13] year of 69 A.D. and give a
[22:13 --> 22:14] deeper introduction to the men
[22:14 --> 22:15] who will vie for the throne.
[22:16 --> 22:17] But I can tell you this much
[22:17 --> 22:18] already.
[22:18 --> 22:20] The correct answer is
[22:20 --> 22:20] Vespasian.

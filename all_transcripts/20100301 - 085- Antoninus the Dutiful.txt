[00:48 --> 00:53] Just remember to go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash Rome so that they know who sent
[00:54 --> 01:08] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 85, Antoninus the Dutiful.
[01:08 --> 01:13] When Hadrian died in 138, there was no succession issue whatsoever.
[01:13 --> 01:19] Unlike Trajan's neo-Alexandrian silence on the subject and the subsequent doubt and violence
[01:19 --> 01:24] that surrounded Hadrian's rise to power, when Antoninus alias Caesar returned to Rome
[01:24 --> 01:29] with the body of the now dead emperor, he was welcomed with open arms by the Senate,
[01:29 --> 01:33] the people, and the army, especially the Senate.
[01:33 --> 01:37] They never had been happy with Hadrian, and from the very beginning, he had been a boogeyman
[01:37 --> 01:42] in their collective consciousness with his every act, statement, or decree twisted up
[01:42 --> 01:47] in their minds to prove that he was actually a dangerous psychopath.
[01:47 --> 01:51] So his death was greeted with barely contained glee, glee enhanced exponentially by the
[01:51 --> 01:55] fact that one of their own was taking over.
[01:55 --> 01:59] Antoninus had, after all, been an amiable senator in good standing for more than twenty
[01:59 --> 02:04] years before being tapped by Hadrian to become his heir.
[02:04 --> 02:08] At least from the aristocratic point of view then, 138 was a banner year.
[02:08 --> 02:14] The monster was dead, and a senator-senator now sat on the throne.
[02:14 --> 02:18] Every previous emperor had made their name in the legions, or because they were the blood
[02:18 --> 02:22] relative of one of those men who had made their name in the legions.
[02:22 --> 02:28] The only real exception was Nerva, and he had been an executive agent all the way.
[02:28 --> 02:32] Antoninus was unique then, as having made his career as a senator first and foremost,
[02:32 --> 02:36] and the years he would spend on the throne would prove to be the most internally harmonious
[02:36 --> 02:39] in the history of the empire.
[02:39 --> 02:44] For the first time in a long time, the aristocracy was fused and of one mind.
[02:44 --> 02:49] The emperor and the senate, thinking and acting almost as one.
[02:49 --> 02:53] And unlike previous periods of senatorial ascendancy, which usually led to unrest among
[02:53 --> 02:59] the general population due to the arrogance of the oligarchs, Antoninus never forgot that
[02:59 --> 03:03] he was everyone's emperor, and made sure his subjects, all of them, were well taken
[03:03 --> 03:04] care of.
[03:04 --> 03:09] There is a reason traditional Roman historiography has the middle of the second century mark
[03:09 --> 03:15] down as the golden age of the Antonines, the zenith of an empire at the height of its power,
[03:15 --> 03:20] at peace at home and abroad, happy, productive, and safe.
[03:20 --> 03:24] But is this vivid image of a golden age an overblown myth?
[03:24 --> 03:28] As with most golden age fantasies, probably a bit.
[03:28 --> 03:32] One of the major problems we have in dealing with the age of Antoninus is the complete
[03:32 --> 03:36] lack of primary sources that deal with the period.
[03:36 --> 03:40] We have some fragments from Cassius Dio, who was born right around the time of Antoninus's
[03:40 --> 03:47] death, and a complete, but somewhat suspect biography in the Historia Augusta.
[03:47 --> 03:52] The same was basically true for Trajan and Hadrian's reigns, but with one major difference.
[03:52 --> 03:56] Those guys actually, you know, did things.
[03:56 --> 04:00] The architectural monuments they built, the wars they waged, the cities they founded,
[04:00 --> 04:05] all now serve as a record of their lives set in stone, and historians can piece together
[04:05 --> 04:10] a much richer accounting of their reigns than they can of Antoninus, who eschewed practically
[04:10 --> 04:12] all of those things.
[04:12 --> 04:16] But in choosing not to partake in the glory hunting and monument building that defined
[04:16 --> 04:22] his predecessors, Antoninus may have ironically done more for his reputation than had he emulated
[04:22 --> 04:23] them.
[04:23 --> 04:27] Because the relative lack of a record means that when we think about the man, we couple
[04:27 --> 04:32] a few glowing summaries of his reign with the fact that there were no major wars or
[04:32 --> 04:37] revolts or scandals, or really anything that makes historical headlines, and emerged with
[04:37 --> 04:42] a portrait of an emperor who ruled over, well, a golden age.
[04:42 --> 04:47] In addition to some medium-sized crises obscured over the years, which we'll get to in a bit,
[04:47 --> 04:52] the shine on Antoninus's golden age is dulled somewhat by what Rome endured following his
[04:52 --> 04:54] death.
[04:54 --> 04:59] That is to say that the one major sustained criticism of his time in office is that Antoninus
[04:59 --> 05:05] kicked a lot of cans down the road, and left it to his successors to use nine stitches,
[05:05 --> 05:10] where a single stitch sewed years earlier would have sufficed.
[05:10 --> 05:14] That is not to say that he was a bad ruler, just that the warm glowing glow that surrounds
[05:14 --> 05:18] his reputation needs to be turned down just a bit.
[05:18 --> 05:23] His conservative resistance to change wins him justifiable plaudits for ensuring a stable
[05:23 --> 05:28] and peaceful empire while he reigned, but at the same time, it left Rome unprepared to
[05:28 --> 05:32] deal with a fast-changing world after he died.
[05:32 --> 05:37] Rome's great genius had always been founded on an ability to adapt quickly to circumstance,
[05:37 --> 05:43] and under Antoninus, that genius atrophied.
[05:43 --> 05:47] One of the first things we should note about Antoninus's reign is that it was definitely
[05:47 --> 05:50] not supposed to last as long as it did.
[05:50 --> 05:55] Fifty-one years old at the time of his ascension, ten years older than Hadrian had been at the
[05:55 --> 06:00] ascension, a reign of around a decade would have been right in line with average life
[06:00 --> 06:05] expectancies and probably what Hadrian had in mind when he plucked Antoninus's name
[06:05 --> 06:07] out of the hat.
[06:07 --> 06:12] As I said last time, the plan was probably to season Marcus Aurelius enough so that he
[06:12 --> 06:16] would not don the purple too young, which would have left him easy prey for manipulative
[06:16 --> 06:22] advisers, while simultaneously not denying the obviously talented boy's ascension for
[06:22 --> 06:24] too long.
[06:24 --> 06:30] But Antoninus lived and lived and lived well into his seventies.
[06:30 --> 06:35] Young Prince Marcus, who was supposed to become young Emperor Marcus, was forced to wait in
[06:35 --> 06:41] the wings for twenty-three years, becoming instead just another middle-aged emperor.
[06:41 --> 06:44] Not that there was anything wrong with that, just that if Hadrian was planning to leave
[06:44 --> 06:49] Rome in the hands of some splendid youth, Antoninus's simple taste and prudent aversion
[06:49 --> 06:54] to risk killed that plan dead.
[06:54 --> 06:58] The second thing we should note about the beginning of Antoninus's reign is just how
[06:58 --> 07:04] quickly he gained the title Pius, which would come to be his defining cognomen.
[07:04 --> 07:08] There are two competing theories about where the name comes from, but both have to do with
[07:08 --> 07:12] his actions immediately following the death of Hadrian.
[07:12 --> 07:17] The most common version is that when his adoptive father died, Antoninus personally escorted
[07:17 --> 07:22] the body back to Rome and then asked the Senate to deify the dead Emperor.
[07:22 --> 07:26] While they certainly did not hate Hadrian as much as they had demission, and so there
[07:26 --> 07:31] was no clamor to damn his memory, the Senate had no intention of declaring the nonetheless
[07:31 --> 07:34] despised Hadrian a god.
[07:34 --> 07:40] The Senate was incredulous at the request, and doubly so because it was coming from Antoninus,
[07:40 --> 07:43] who they considered one of their own.
[07:43 --> 07:47] Surely he of all people would understand why they were refusing the request.
[07:47 --> 07:50] But Antoninus surprisingly persisted.
[07:50 --> 07:55] He told them that to refuse to deify Hadrian would stand as a repudiation of his entire
[07:55 --> 08:00] reign and thus every decision he had made along the way, up to and including his choice
[08:00 --> 08:01] of heir.
[08:01 --> 08:06] To repudiate Hadrian, Antoninus said, is to repudiate me.
[08:06 --> 08:11] Which is fine, I will gladly lay aside the burden of empire and leave it to you or the
[08:11 --> 08:15] army or whoever to decide who ought to rule.
[08:15 --> 08:18] This calculated threat did the trick.
[08:18 --> 08:22] Power vacuums were feared at least as much as tyrants were hated, and by forcing the
[08:22 --> 08:28] Senate to face the former they abandoned their condemnation of the latter.
[08:28 --> 08:32] Hadrian was duly deified with all honors, and Antoninus' steadfast loyalty to his
[08:32 --> 08:37] adoptive father in the face of perhaps even his own doubts was lauded throughout the empire
[08:37 --> 08:43] as a supreme example of a son's duty to his father, hence the name Pius, which in Latin
[08:43 --> 08:46] translates as dutiful.
[08:46 --> 08:50] He did not stop the deification process either.
[08:50 --> 08:56] Antoninus piously, dutifully, completed Hadrian's as of yet unfinished mausoleum and in 139
[08:56 --> 09:02] dedicated the new tomb and placed Hadrian's ashes within.
[09:02 --> 09:06] The other version of the story is that when Antoninus ascended to the throne, he canceled
[09:06 --> 09:11] death warrants and confiscation orders and prison sentences issued by Hadrian during
[09:11 --> 09:14] his last heartless days.
[09:14 --> 09:19] The grateful senators, many of whom were caught up in this mini reign of terror, affixed their
[09:19 --> 09:24] brother Antoninus with the title Pius to recognize the good work he had done sparing them from
[09:24 --> 09:27] their unjust fates.
[09:27 --> 09:32] Whichever version is true, Antoninus alias Caesar quickly became Antoninus Pius, the
[09:32 --> 09:35] name by which we know him today.
[09:35 --> 09:40] The two stories are of course not mutually exclusive, and the whole package of Antoninus'
[09:40 --> 09:45] loyalty to Hadrian and the clemency he showed towards his adoptive father's enemies could
[09:45 --> 09:52] have both worked to reinforce the image of Antoninus as a just and moral ruler.
[09:52 --> 09:57] Once he had done his duty to Hadrian though, he quietly stepped out of his adoptive father's
[09:57 --> 10:03] shadow and became his own man, in many ways the polar opposite of the emperor he had honored.
[10:03 --> 10:08] Where Hadrian attained distinction for his traveling, for his urgent need to be everywhere
[10:09 --> 10:15] and see for himself the empire he ruled, Antoninus is best known for not having gone anywhere.
[10:15 --> 10:21] In his 23 years in power, he never once left Italy, a remarkable feat when you think about
[10:21 --> 10:22] it.
[10:22 --> 10:26] Even if they accomplished little with their presence, most emperors at least liked to
[10:26 --> 10:31] visit various hot spots for the photo opportunities they presented.
[10:31 --> 10:35] An exception was Vespasian, who stayed put in Rome for the most part during his decade
[10:35 --> 10:40] on the throne, but he had already been all over and had earned, as it were, his retirement
[10:40 --> 10:41] in the capital.
[10:41 --> 10:47] Antoninus, on the other hand, except for a brief stint as a procurator in Asia, had been
[10:47 --> 10:52] an Italian homebody and after donning the purple, saw no reason to change his ways,
[10:52 --> 10:57] and perhaps felt an even greater need to stay in the capital to reinforce Rome and Italy's
[10:57 --> 11:02] preeminence after Hadrian's more equalitarian views on the distinction between province
[11:02 --> 11:08] and home peninsula had battered Italy's prestige.
[11:08 --> 11:12] The Italian-centric approach to governance extended beyond the basic fact that the emperor
[11:12 --> 11:15] lived and ruled from the capital.
[11:15 --> 11:20] As I mentioned during the episodes on Hadrian and Trajan, the Roman Empire was fast losing
[11:20 --> 11:22] its Roman character.
[11:22 --> 11:27] Both of the previous two emperors were provincials, and Hadrian especially had promoted elites
[11:27 --> 11:33] from the provinces into the senate and admitted them into his own circle of advisors.
[11:33 --> 11:37] At first, one might think Antoninus would continue this movement, as his own family
[11:37 --> 11:43] originated in Gaul, but the new emperor instead backed the old Roman elite, and when it came
[11:43 --> 11:48] time to appoint proconsuls and generals and members of his governing council, he relied
[11:48 --> 11:51] heavily on men of Italian origin.
[11:51 --> 11:56] With the future of the empire clearly out in the provinces, the age of Antoninus then
[11:56 --> 12:02] stands as the last time the emperor that had been founded and won and held by Italians
[12:02 --> 12:07] was really actively run by them as well.
[12:07 --> 12:11] Antoninus was also Hadrian's opposite in administrative outlook.
[12:11 --> 12:17] Where Hadrian was driven by a compulsion to improve, to reform, to rejigger, Antoninus
[12:17 --> 12:22] was driven by a compulsion to protect, to entrench, and to maintain.
[12:22 --> 12:28] In Antoninus's opinion, the imperial governmental apparatus he inherited worked just fine.
[12:28 --> 12:33] It needed to be maintained, sure, kept free of corruption and inefficiency and all that,
[12:33 --> 12:35] but there was no reason to reinvent the wheel.
[12:35 --> 12:40] The only real innovation introduced during Antoninus's reign was in fact an extension
[12:40 --> 12:43] of this conservatism.
[12:43 --> 12:48] When he took office, he kept on most of Hadrian's staff and extended bureaucracy, itself something
[12:48 --> 12:55] of a novel concept, one that sharply contrasted Hadrian's purge of so-called Trajan men.
[12:55 --> 13:00] But the real shift was the extension of proconsulships, procuratorships, legionary commands, and
[13:00 --> 13:04] all that to terms of five years or more.
[13:04 --> 13:09] The Roman aversion to extended terms of office was a prejudice that traced back to the founding
[13:09 --> 13:15] of the republic, and while extraordinary extensions did occur, Caesar and Gaul, for example, these
[13:15 --> 13:18] were most definitely the exception rather than the rule.
[13:18 --> 13:24] Antoninus, though, was temperamentally partial to continuity and saw the constant office
[13:24 --> 13:29] rotations as a bug rather than a feature of imperial administration.
[13:29 --> 13:34] A procurator would spend a year in some province, and just as he was getting to know the particular
[13:34 --> 13:39] challenges of the territory, he would be replaced by someone else who knew nothing about anything.
[13:39 --> 13:44] It was silly, and on the frontier provinces, it was dangerous.
[13:44 --> 13:50] So for example, under Antoninus, Quintus Lolius Urbicus served as governor of Britain for
[13:50 --> 13:56] five years, while Papilius Charis Pado served as governor of Upper Germany for nine years,
[13:56 --> 13:59] between 152 and 161.
[13:59 --> 14:05] His praetorian prefect Marcus Gavius Maximus served an unprecedented twenty years, from
[14:05 --> 14:13] 138 to 158, despite persistent calls for his removal for a laundry list of sins.
[14:13 --> 14:18] His emphasis on continuity over novelty was also evident in Antoninus' attitude towards
[14:18 --> 14:20] public works.
[14:20 --> 14:25] Dating back to the reign of Domitian and culminating with Hadrian's empire-wide architectural
[14:25 --> 14:31] orgy, Antoninus' predecessors had used extensive building projects to modernize the empire,
[14:31 --> 14:35] create jobs, and leave everlasting monuments to their own greatness.
[14:35 --> 14:40] Antoninus, on the other hand, more or less abandoned new construction and focused instead
[14:40 --> 14:43] on maintaining what was already existent.
[14:43 --> 14:49] Because not only was he temperamentally disinclined to initiate change, but he was also temperamentally
[14:49 --> 14:55] disinclined to drain the imperial treasury in a quest to build a better temple.
[14:55 --> 14:59] It is a fitting monument to Antoninus, then, that the one place we do see his name inscribed
[14:59 --> 15:04] over and over again are on the mile markers of the Roman highway system.
[15:04 --> 15:10] Good, properly marked and maintained roads, worthy expenditures, a mighty column or a
[15:10 --> 15:13] new amphitheater, not so much.
[15:13 --> 15:18] This is not to say that building simply ceased across the empire, only that the emperor was
[15:18 --> 15:21] no longer footing the bill.
[15:21 --> 15:25] Local elites were leaned on heavily to defray the costs of the projects they petitioned
[15:25 --> 15:27] the emperor to pay for.
[15:27 --> 15:31] If they wanted new baths so badly, surely they could find the necessary cash buried
[15:31 --> 15:36] somewhere on the grounds of their extravagant estates.
[15:36 --> 15:40] But if he was a bit of a miser with public funds, Antoninus was generous with his own
[15:40 --> 15:43] personal fortune.
[15:43 --> 15:47] An incredibly wealthy man when he ascended to the throne, Antoninus was careful to separate
[15:47 --> 15:53] the imperial treasury he inherited from the personal fortune he had already accrued.
[15:53 --> 15:58] The former he watched over like a hawk and curtailed as much as he could lavish expenditures.
[15:58 --> 16:03] But the latter he dispersed generously for a variety of worthy causes.
[16:03 --> 16:08] So unlike say Tiberius, whose reputation as a miser with the imperial accounts was not
[16:08 --> 16:14] offset by personal generosity, Antoninus' reputation never suffered for his public tight
[16:14 --> 16:16] fistedness.
[16:16 --> 16:21] During a particularly bad famine, he personally paid for and delivered the olive oil and grains
[16:21 --> 16:25] that people could no longer afford due to shortages.
[16:25 --> 16:30] When earthquakes struck or fires broke out, as they frequently did throughout the empire,
[16:30 --> 16:36] Antoninus would underwrite the emergency response and rebuilding efforts out of his own pocket.
[16:36 --> 16:41] He understood that the coin of the princeps had two sides, Heads, executive administrator
[16:41 --> 16:47] of a transnational empire who must be careful to protect the fiscal integrity of the state,
[16:47 --> 16:55] and Tails, a private first citizen who must lead generously by example.
[16:55 --> 17:01] When it came to foreign policy though, Antoninus was every bit Hadrian's disciple.
[17:01 --> 17:06] Critics have described it dismissively as a policy of peace at any price.
[17:06 --> 17:11] But Antoninus definitely followed Hadrian in believing it to be more accurately characterized
[17:11 --> 17:15] as peace at a lower price.
[17:15 --> 17:19] Legionary activity did not cease during Antoninus' reign, as we'll see in a moment, but it was
[17:19 --> 17:24] only deployed in situations where it was literally unavoidable.
[17:24 --> 17:29] War is an expensive undertaking in both money and manpower, and usually costs ten times
[17:29 --> 17:33] as much as you thought it would going in, to say nothing of the fact that it usually
[17:33 --> 17:38] took twice as long as you thought it would to win the damn thing.
[17:38 --> 17:42] Keeping a potentially unruly tribe or neighboring kingdom as a client on the other hand was
[17:42 --> 17:49] often not just a cheaper alternative to fighting, but also a more predictable accounting strategy.
[17:49 --> 17:54] This is where Antoninus takes the most lumps for kicking the can down the road though,
[17:54 --> 18:00] as though this policy of pseudo-bribery worked, Antoninus was loath to extend it any further.
[18:00 --> 18:05] He inherited Hadrian's long list of client kings and auxiliary tribes, and continued
[18:05 --> 18:10] the financial exchanges that ensured their loyalty, but he was hesitant to add new members
[18:10 --> 18:12] to the roles.
[18:12 --> 18:17] He was approached often by emissaries from various foreign tribes or nations asking for
[18:17 --> 18:24] admittance into the empire proper or status as clients or recognition as friends of Rome.
[18:24 --> 18:28] But Antoninus turned them all down on the grounds that the empire was at its maximum
[18:28 --> 18:35] defensible extent, and besides, he simply couldn't afford to take on any new clients.
[18:35 --> 18:40] This worked fine during his own reign, but eventually, jealousy from those on the outs
[18:40 --> 18:45] and suspicions from those on the ins that Rome had become an extortable paper tiger
[18:45 --> 18:50] led to an explosion of violence in the north and war with Parthia in the east during the
[18:50 --> 18:55] reign of Marcus Aurelius.
[18:55 --> 18:59] As I just mentioned though, it was not as if Rome was literally at peace in all places
[18:59 --> 19:03] during the peace-at-any-price age of Antoninus.
[19:03 --> 19:08] In Britain, a significant uprising among the Brigantes, whose territory Hadrian had bisected
[19:08 --> 19:14] with his famous wall, was put down by the aforementioned Lolaeus Urbicus after two years
[19:14 --> 19:18] of intense fighting that led the Romans to push their frontier a hundred miles north
[19:18 --> 19:24] and establish a second wall known as the Antonine Wall around the spot where Agricola had once
[19:24 --> 19:27] defeated the Caledonians.
[19:27 --> 19:32] There was also on-again, off-again fighting in Africa where Moorish nomads became emboldened
[19:32 --> 19:37] and began to descend out of the Atlas Mountains to harass the province of Mauritania.
[19:37 --> 19:41] The problem with the Moors would only get worse during the reign of Marcus Aurelius,
[19:41 --> 19:46] and Antoninus' failure to nip the problem in the bud with more vigorous action was seen
[19:46 --> 19:51] as one of the time bombs he unnecessarily handed off to his successors.
[19:51 --> 19:56] In the east, there were uprisings in Egypt and the newly renamed province of Palestine
[19:56 --> 20:02] that both required a military response, and along the Danube, a revolt in 158 necessitated
[20:02 --> 20:07] the division of the province into two districts to effectively divide and conquer the unruly
[20:07 --> 20:09] natives.
[20:09 --> 20:14] However, despite the fact that Roman military activity never ceased, even during this golden
[20:14 --> 20:20] age of peace, there were no great wars of any magnitude and Antoninus' diplomacy and
[20:20 --> 20:26] bribery did the trick to keep Rome out of large-scale conflicts.
[20:26 --> 20:31] In his most famous diplomatic coup, a single letter sent to the Parthian king advising
[20:31 --> 20:35] that encroachment on Roman territory would not be taken lightly was enough to dissuade
[20:35 --> 20:40] Parthian expansion plans.
[20:40 --> 20:44] Probably the one major difference between Hadrian and Antoninus though, when it came
[20:44 --> 20:48] to their peace policy at least, was that Hadrian was fanatical about drilling and keeping the
[20:48 --> 20:52] legions constantly active and alert.
[20:52 --> 20:56] This state of persistent readiness left them more than ready to deal with any unavoidable
[20:56 --> 20:58] conflict that might arise.
[20:58 --> 21:04] Antoninus, on the other hand, who had no military experience and never once so much as ventured
[21:04 --> 21:09] into a legionary camp, allowed a sense of complacency to set in that would leave Marcus
[21:09 --> 21:14] Aurelius in a bit of a bind when both the Parthian Empire in the east and Germanic tribes
[21:14 --> 21:23] in the north exploded into Roman territory shortly after Antoninus' death.
[21:23 --> 21:28] As I mentioned, for all of these crises, the frontier battles and the foreign diplomacy,
[21:28 --> 21:31] Antoninus himself never left Rome.
[21:31 --> 21:35] He ruled entirely by way of correspondence.
[21:35 --> 21:40] But if we begin to form a picture of Antoninus as a sort of absentee emperor, we should correct
[21:40 --> 21:42] that image immediately.
[21:42 --> 21:47] He was active in all aspects of administration and was thoroughly engaged in the welfare
[21:47 --> 21:49] of the empire he ruled.
[21:49 --> 21:54] Cutting a middle road between Trajan's figure it out for yourself and Hadrian's I'll be
[21:54 --> 21:58] there in a few days to tell you what to do, Antoninus and his aides poured through the
[21:58 --> 22:04] incoming dispatches and did their best to advise, define, approve and disapprove the
[22:04 --> 22:10] myriad requests for instructions, aid and funding that came in.
[22:10 --> 22:16] But not content to passively react, Antoninus, especially as it related to financial matters,
[22:16 --> 22:21] constantly studied the books and demanded explanations from his various provincial officials
[22:21 --> 22:24] to justify their decisions and their appropriation.
[22:24 --> 22:30] Disrupt officials, when discovered, were dealt with swiftly and harshly.
[22:30 --> 22:34] Antoninus had no time for dishonesty or selfish misappropriation.
[22:34 --> 22:41] Governance was a sacred trust that he took very seriously.
[22:41 --> 22:45] Antoninus's concern for the welfare of his subjects, evidenced by his generous response
[22:45 --> 22:50] to disasters and his intense focus on maintaining just and honest governance, extended even
[22:50 --> 22:56] to a usually invisible segment of the population, slaves.
[22:56 --> 23:00] Antoninus continued the trend of allowing more rights to the living engines of the Roman
[23:00 --> 23:01] economy.
[23:01 --> 23:06] I plan to deal more with slavery next week, but suffice it to say, following the slave
[23:06 --> 23:12] revolts of the late republic that culminated with Spartacus's war, the Roman elite began
[23:12 --> 23:16] to think differently about the servants who surrounded them.
[23:16 --> 23:20] The belief that slaves were so much inanimate property that could be used and abused at
[23:20 --> 23:24] will gave way to a more humane attitude.
[23:24 --> 23:30] During Antoninus's reign, this trend reached its logical conclusion with the emperor codifying
[23:30 --> 23:36] the idea that just as a slave had a duty to his master, a master had a duty to his slave.
[23:36 --> 23:41] In some cases, a cruel master could be ordered to sell his slaves, and in all cases, the
[23:41 --> 23:45] murder of a slave was now considered homicide.
[23:45 --> 23:51] But again, this was the logical extension of a hundreds year long trend, and Antoninus
[23:51 --> 23:55] should not be considered some human rights radical.
[23:55 --> 24:00] If slavery was going to survive as an institution, as the emperor felt that it justly should,
[24:00 --> 24:04] these rights needed to be extended to prevent mass uprisings.
[24:04 --> 24:12] Cruel masters were a national security threat more than they were a moral affront.
[24:12 --> 24:17] Again as a whole, the picture we get of Antoninus is a man who wants tomorrow to be like today,
[24:17 --> 24:20] and today to be like yesterday.
[24:20 --> 24:26] He was conservative in his approach to practically every aspect of his public and personal life,
[24:26 --> 24:31] believing his primary function to be the maintenance of what was already good rather than the invention
[24:31 --> 24:34] of something better.
[24:34 --> 24:38] I'm going to stop there for this week because while there are a few more things to say about
[24:38 --> 24:44] Antoninus, specifically about his relationship with Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Severus, the
[24:44 --> 24:49] men who would succeed him, there is not a ton more material to cover.
[24:49 --> 24:54] This however does present us with a nice opportunity to briefly pause our story and focus a bit
[24:54 --> 24:58] on everyday life in the age of the Antonines.
[24:58 --> 25:03] It's been a while since I've docked the SS narrative, but with second century Rome existing
[25:03 --> 25:08] politically, culturally, and economically at the height of its power, it seems like
[25:08 --> 25:12] a perfect time to put into port for a week or two and take a look around.
[25:12 --> 25:18] Plus, Jerome Carcapino's classic daily life in ancient Rome focuses specifically on this
[25:18 --> 25:23] period of the empire, so it seems only natural that we should pause during Antoninus' reign
[25:23 --> 25:26] to think about the bigger picture.
[25:26 --> 25:32] So next week, we'll start digging into social issues and religious trends and economic activities
[25:32 --> 25:36] and all the little things that define the lives and livelihoods of the millions and
[25:36 --> 25:43] millions of people who lived under the Pax Romana of the five good emperors.
[25:43 --> 25:47] The last thing I'll mention is that as a few of you have noticed, we are fast approaching
[25:47 --> 25:50] the hundredth episode of the history of Rome.
[25:50 --> 25:55] I know we are only on episode 85, but with the two part and five part shows, this is
[25:55 --> 26:01] actually the 95th posted episode, and I can assure you that this is the metric I use when
[26:01 --> 26:05] defining which will be the, quote, hundredth episode.
[26:05 --> 26:09] To celebrate, I thought it would be fun to throw the show open to questions from the
[26:09 --> 26:10] floor.
[26:10 --> 26:18] So, if you're interested, go to either thehistoryofrome.typepad.com or the show's official unofficial discussion
[26:18 --> 26:25] group, Forum Galorum, at forumgalorum.freeforums.org and submit your questions to the hundredth
[26:25 --> 26:28] episode threads we've got set up.
[26:28 --> 26:33] The questions can be about anything, Roman things, podcast things, baseball things, personal
[26:34 --> 26:38] things to a point, anything really, so don't feel too constrained.
[26:38 --> 26:43] Basically, if you've ever wondered about something, just go ahead and throw it out there.
[26:43 --> 26:47] I probably won't be able to answer everyone, but I'll do my best to pick out representative
[26:47 --> 26:53] questions that mostly cover what most people are mostly wondering about.
[26:53 --> 26:58] The only question you can't ask is where are the early episodes, because as I'm pleased
[26:58 --> 27:01] to point out, they are now all available on iTunes.
[27:01 --> 27:06] I'm still ironing out the bugs, so the ordering is a bit off, and it looks like iTunes is
[27:06 --> 27:11] doubling up downloading episodes that you already have, which is really annoying, but
[27:11 --> 27:16] going forward, all should be well and everything should stay put.
[27:16 --> 27:20] For those of you who are newcomers, those early episodes can be a bit rough, both in
[27:20 --> 27:24] terms of production and style, so please don't judge them too harshly.
[27:24 --> 27:29] I was, after all, making it up as I went along.
[27:29 --> 27:33] The really, really last thing I'll mention is that the Forum Galorum is also now hosting
[27:33 --> 27:39] a weekly History of Rome chat that launched last week and will occur regularly at noon
[27:39 --> 27:41] U.S. Central Time on Saturdays.
[27:41 --> 27:47] I should be there next weekend and periodically after that schedule permitting, so see you there.

[01:01 --> 01:18] Hello and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 110, A Gothic Horror. We left off
[01:18 --> 01:24] last time in 248 AD when a short-lived rebellion in Moesia prompted Philip the Arab to send
[01:24 --> 01:31] the respected Senator Gaius Decius to the Danube to get the situation back under control.
[01:31 --> 01:36] Sending out Decius was supposed to help secure the future of Philip's rule, but instead it
[01:36 --> 01:43] was the catalyst for his demise. Decius arrived in the north and began making the rounds,
[01:43 --> 01:48] inspecting this and telling someone to tuck in that, and all the while believed that he
[01:48 --> 01:54] really was going to spend the next year or so restoring discipline to the Danube legions.
[01:54 --> 02:00] But the Danube legions had other ideas. They had flinched from their first rebellion, possibly
[02:00 --> 02:06] because Peccatianus was too much of a nobody to be taken seriously as emperor, but Decius,
[02:06 --> 02:12] well you could really picture him draped in the purple. So, with their grievances still
[02:12 --> 02:17] unaddressed, they decided to make another play at revolution, this time with Decius
[02:17 --> 02:25] as their leader. In the spring of 249, the troops surprised their new commander one morning
[02:25 --> 02:31] by hailing him as emperor. They demanded that he lead them to Italy, where together they
[02:31 --> 02:37] would unseat Philip and force the Senate to recognize Decius as the new master of Rome.
[02:37 --> 02:42] Philip's dishonorable peace with the Parthians, coupled with his unwillingness to confront
[02:42 --> 02:47] the Goths, had caused them to lose all respect for the man, and they strongly hinted that
[02:47 --> 02:52] come hell or high water they were going to replace Philip with someone. If Decius wanted
[02:52 --> 02:57] the job, they were willing to give it to him. If not, then, as Philip's loyal agent, they
[02:57 --> 03:04] were going to kill him. Reluctantly, Decius agreed to lead them.
[03:04 --> 03:08] His noble reluctance is always noted in the histories, but it's worth remembering that
[03:08 --> 03:15] he was not so reluctant that he refused what they were offering.
[03:15 --> 03:20] Leaving behind the troops necessary to garrison the frontier, Decius led, or followed as some
[03:20 --> 03:24] of the histories imply, the rest of the men on a march to Italy, where they planned to
[03:24 --> 03:30] confront Philip and force him to abdicate. Word reached Rome soon after that the troops
[03:30 --> 03:36] were on the move, and Philip scrambled to assemble a defense force. There was no such
[03:36 --> 03:41] thing as a nice, quiet abdication at this point in Roman history, and Philip knew that
[03:41 --> 03:45] if he wanted to keep his head, he was going to have to keep his throne, and if he wanted
[03:45 --> 03:50] to keep his throne, he was going to have to fight for it.
[03:50 --> 03:55] The preparations were no doubt fraught with desperation. Philip knew full well he wouldn't
[03:55 --> 04:00] be able to raise enough troops to match the size of Decius' force, but the year of the
[04:00 --> 04:05] six emperors had proved that Italy could ward off an angry legionary force given the right
[04:05 --> 04:09] amount of luck and determination, so it's not like Philip necessarily believed he was
[04:09 --> 04:16] preparing for some suicidal last stand. But luck and determination were not on Philip's
[04:16 --> 04:23] side. Decius was no Maximinus Thrax, and Philip was no hardy Brotherhood of Senators valiantly
[04:23 --> 04:28] defending the honor of Italy from an evil tyrant. So, the story played out differently
[04:28 --> 04:32] this time.
[04:32 --> 04:38] In the summer of 249, Decius and Philip faced off near Verona in northern Italy. Despite
[04:39 --> 04:43] frequent letters swearing fealty to the emperor, Decius was unable to calm the temper of his
[04:43 --> 04:50] men, and however he felt in his heart, that all took a backseat when it came time to act.
[04:50 --> 04:56] The two sides joined in a short battle, and Philip's army was easily routed. It is unclear
[04:56 --> 05:00] whether he and his son were killed during the fighting itself or a few days after their
[05:00 --> 05:06] defeat, but within a week of the battle, Philip was dead, and Decius was on his way to Rome
[05:06 --> 05:13] to have the Senate ratify his ascension to the throne. Philip the Arab was 44 years old,
[05:13 --> 05:18] and had ruled the empire for five years.
[05:18 --> 05:23] As I said, Decius was no Maximinus Thrax, and the Senate was more than happy to raise
[05:23 --> 05:29] one of their own to the purple. In addition to the title Augustus, they also gave Decius
[05:29 --> 05:35] the honorific Traeonus, a hopeful nod that the new emperor would prove to be as wise
[05:35 --> 05:40] and as capable as the great Trajan had been.
[05:40 --> 05:44] Decius sent the legions who had carried him to power back to the Danube while he himself
[05:44 --> 05:50] stayed in Rome to consolidate power and take stock of the empire he now led. The Moesian
[05:50 --> 05:55] legions received a healthy donative for their day's work, temporarily stilling their desire
[05:55 --> 06:00] for a war with the Goths. Eventually though, they would get their war, and soon come to
[06:00 --> 06:06] realize that maybe they shouldn't have been quite so eager to take on the northern barbarians.
[06:06 --> 06:10] This moment of realization probably came right around the time they were all being hacked
[06:10 --> 06:16] to death in a muddy, bloody swamp.
[06:16 --> 06:20] When Decius was done taking stock of the empire, he declared that he did not much like what
[06:20 --> 06:27] he saw. The Sassanids had been dishonorably paid off in the east, the Goths menaced the
[06:28 --> 06:33] and Rome itself was a cesspool of vice and corruption. The Roman Empire had lost its
[06:33 --> 06:39] way and the new emperor was determined to get it back on the right track.
[06:39 --> 06:45] The main problem, Decius decided, was not shifting demographics or economic fluctuations
[06:45 --> 06:52] or the threat of foreign invasion, but rather the loss of public virtue. That virtue, which
[06:53 --> 06:58] had helped Rome win the favor of the Goths, had been abandoned, and so the Goths had abandoned
[06:58 --> 07:00] Rome.
[07:00 --> 07:05] To help the empire get back on the good side of those supernatural forces that obviously
[07:05 --> 07:11] determined the course of earthly affairs, Decius dreamed up two major initiatives. First,
[07:11 --> 07:16] he was going to demand that every citizen in the empire offer sacrifices to convince
[07:16 --> 07:22] the Goths that Rome had not forsaken them, and second, he was going to revive the long
[07:22 --> 07:27] abandoned office of censor so that someone would be in place to regulate and legislate
[07:27 --> 07:31] public morality.
[07:31 --> 07:35] Taken together, Decius figured that this would be enough to please the Goths and prevent
[07:35 --> 07:40] them from keeping any more misery on the Romans. It seems, though, that given what's about
[07:40 --> 07:47] to happen, the Goths were not at all impressed by these offerings.
[07:47 --> 07:53] Decius started in January of 250 by issuing his famous edict that every citizen of the
[07:53 --> 08:00] empire must offer a sacrifice to the Goths on behalf of the emperor. The edict seems
[08:00 --> 08:05] innocuously pious enough, but it was well known that a certain minority of citizens
[08:05 --> 08:10] were going to have a big problem with this seemingly simple request, and it is completely
[08:10 --> 08:15] plausible that Decius's idea of getting back on the good side of the Goths had nothing
[08:15 --> 08:21] to do with sacrifices at all, but instead had everything to do with the complete suppression
[08:21 --> 08:25] of Christianity.
[08:25 --> 08:29] The mechanics of the edict were simple. A magistrate would announce that everyone in
[08:29 --> 08:34] his municipality had, say, thirty days to offer the proper sacrifices, and then you
[08:34 --> 08:40] would be issued a ticket after having performed said sacrifices. The officials would then
[08:40 --> 08:44] come around after the thirty days were up and make sure everyone had their ticket, and
[08:44 --> 08:51] if you didn't have it, well, that was treason, and treason meant torture and death.
[08:52 --> 08:57] Across the empire, Christians heard about the edict, immediately recognized it as being
[08:57 --> 09:01] totally incompatible with their belief system, and tried to figure out what exactly they
[09:01 --> 09:08] were going to do. Some broke right away, made the necessary sacrifices, and either left
[09:08 --> 09:14] Christianity behind forever, or asked for forgiveness after the fact. But most refused,
[09:14 --> 09:20] and hoped that the Roman authorities would not pursue any heavy-handed reprisals. What
[09:20 --> 09:24] was the big deal if a few Christians didn't take part in these pagan rituals? They paid
[09:24 --> 09:29] their taxes and kept out of trouble, and for the last few years that had been more than
[09:29 --> 09:33] enough to keep them flying below the imperial radar.
[09:33 --> 09:38] But Decius had no intention of pursuing a policy of toleration, and when the first batch
[09:38 --> 09:43] of Christians let time expire without making a sacrifice, Decius recommended to the local
[09:43 --> 09:50] authorities that they go ahead with the torture and the executions. Like a wave spreading
[09:50 --> 09:54] across the empire, defiant Christians were rounded up and killed as the deadline for
[09:54 --> 10:01] sacrificing came and went in each new province.
[10:01 --> 10:06] Over the course of 250, thousands of Christians, both prominent and obscure, were executed,
[10:06 --> 10:11] including Pope Fabian, who set the tone for the faithful by accepting martyrdom at the
[10:11 --> 10:18] end of January 250, not long after the edict was first issued. Perhaps revealing what this
[10:18 --> 10:23] was all really about, Decius then prevented the Christians from electing a new bishop
[10:23 --> 10:27] of Rome, and the office remained vacant until the emperor left the capital to go fight the
[10:27 --> 10:31] Goths 18 months later.
[10:31 --> 10:36] Not to get too far off into ecclesiastic history, but when a new pope finally was elected
[10:36 --> 10:41] again, it set off a minor schism within the church over the question of how exactly to
[10:41 --> 10:47] treat those Christians who had made the sacrifices and now wanted to return to the church. Did
[10:47 --> 10:52] they need to be rebaptized, or was sincere repentance enough?
[10:52 --> 10:57] This was a heavy question that caused a great deal of angry debate, so while not succeeding
[10:57 --> 11:03] in eliminating Christianity, Decius did do much to sow some serious discord within the
[11:03 --> 11:05] church.
[11:05 --> 11:12] While the persecution of Christians raged across the empire, Decius made a play to further
[11:12 --> 11:17] reintroduce the Romans to the virtuous ways of their forefathers by reviving the office
[11:17 --> 11:24] of censor. But rather than claiming the title for himself as previous emperors had done,
[11:24 --> 11:30] Decius picked a man he thought worthy of the job, and offered Publius Lichenius Valerianus
[11:30 --> 11:37] the opportunity to lead Rome's moral revival. But Valerian, as we know him today, thought
[11:37 --> 11:42] long and hard about the offer, and in the end risked the wrath of the emperor by declining
[11:42 --> 11:45] to take the job.
[11:45 --> 11:50] Not only was the task shaping up to be an impossible one, hey, you see that water over
[11:51 --> 11:57] make it run uphill, okay? But the censorship was, when you read the fine print, an incredibly
[11:57 --> 12:03] powerful office. To don the title of censor would be to don a title that would make Valerian
[12:03 --> 12:10] practically the equal of Decius, and that was a very dangerous place to be. He could
[12:10 --> 12:15] see that in time that kind of power would probably make Decius violently paranoid, even
[12:15 --> 12:20] if it had been his idea to begin with.
[12:20 --> 12:25] Valerian was a smart guy, the job was impossible, and the position was just too dangerous. No
[12:25 --> 12:32] good could come of it, so he declined. He told Decius that the office was too august
[12:32 --> 12:38] to be held by anyone but the Augustus himself, and asked instead for a regular old military
[12:38 --> 12:45] posting in Germany. Decius granted the request and let Valerian slip away with his head intact.
[12:45 --> 12:51] We do not know whether the emperor planned to let the matter drop completely, or whether
[12:51 --> 12:55] he was dead set on bringing the censor back to Rome, because shortly after Valerian's
[12:55 --> 13:02] refusal, the Goths once again invaded the empire, bringing an end to Decius's experiments
[13:02 --> 13:06] with public virtue.
[13:06 --> 13:12] In late 250, a Gothic king named Knieve, that's the pronunciation I'm going with, led an
[13:12 --> 13:18] army across the Danube and began running amok in Thrace and Moesia. Though we call this
[13:18 --> 13:25] army the Goths, they were actually a far more cosmopolitan force than the name suggests.
[13:26 --> 13:30] Knieve raised a standard that Germans and Sarmatians and even a healthy number of Roman
[13:30 --> 13:36] deserters flocked to, so while we call them the Goths, remember that a number of different
[13:36 --> 13:41] nationalities all fought for Knieve, not just the Goths themselves, though they were the
[13:41 --> 13:44] thick trunk of the invading army.
[13:44 --> 13:50] Knieve's forces overran the border defenses easily, which was what prompted so many Roman
[13:50 --> 13:56] soldiers to desert, and after extracting a large payment from Marcianopolis not to sack
[13:56 --> 14:03] their city, the Goths were soon laying siege to the city of Nicopolis. Provincial leaders
[14:03 --> 14:09] begged Decius to personally lead a relief army to evict these most unwelcome guests,
[14:09 --> 14:14] and Decius, recognizing how dire the situation was, immediately began preparations for the
[14:14 --> 14:17] march north.
[14:17 --> 14:23] In early 251, he was on his way along with his 24-year-old son Herennius, who Decius
[14:23 --> 14:30] had induced the Senate to make his co-Augustus shortly before their departure. This new father
[14:30 --> 14:36] and son team was supposed to destroy the Goths and then go on to found a great new dynasty,
[14:36 --> 14:40] but instead what happened is that they both died and went down in history as the first
[14:40 --> 14:44] emperors to fall in battle against a foreign enemy.
[14:44 --> 14:49] The Persians will tell you that honor really belongs to Gordian III, but let's not concern
[14:49 --> 14:53] ourselves with that for now.
[14:53 --> 14:58] The Goths had not taken Nicopolis by the time Decius and his reinforcements arrived, so
[14:58 --> 15:05] Knieve abandoned the siege and headed off for greener pastures. But for the Romans,
[15:05 --> 15:09] this was not about simply coming to the aid of Nicopolis, it was about throwing the Goths
[15:09 --> 15:17] out of the empire entirely. So Decius and his army pursued Knieve across the countryside.
[15:17 --> 15:22] No slouch when it came to strategy and tactics, the Gothic kings saw the Romans coming hot
[15:22 --> 15:26] on his heels and decided to use their headlong charge against them.
[15:26 --> 15:31] Decius was pushing his troops hard on the assumption that Knieve was running as fast
[15:31 --> 15:36] as he could, but what the Gothic king was actually doing was turning his army around
[15:36 --> 15:42] and pointing them straight back at the unsuspecting legions. Believing the Goths to be nowhere
[15:42 --> 15:47] near them, the Romans set up camp for the night, and though guards were of course posted,
[15:47 --> 15:52] no one was expecting to be doing any fighting for at least a couple of days. But then, out
[15:52 --> 15:57] of nowhere, the full Gothic army appeared over a hill and came barreling at the Roman
[15:57 --> 16:03] position. Caught completely off guard, Decius tried to keep his men in line, but the shock
[16:03 --> 16:08] of the attack scattered the legions, and the subsequent retreat involved a lot more running
[16:08 --> 16:14] than the emperor probably would have liked. Satisfied that he had spooked the Romans off
[16:14 --> 16:20] the chase, Knieve then headed off to the nearby city of Philopopolis, which he planned to
[16:20 --> 16:25] sack before the Romans were able to regroup. The Goths were, after all, here to plunder
[16:25 --> 16:31] the wealth of the empire, not engage the legions in unproductive battles. But by not
[16:31 --> 16:36] following up on his surprise attack, Knieve allowed Decius time to reform his embarrassed
[16:36 --> 16:42] army. The emperor rebuilt their confidence by leading them against a series of much smaller
[16:42 --> 16:47] German forces who were attempting to join Knieve's invincible army, and pretty soon
[16:47 --> 16:53] they were feeling okay about themselves again. Knieve's invincible army, though, was only
[16:53 --> 16:59] invincible when fighting in head-to-head battles. When it came to laying siege to cities, they
[16:59 --> 17:04] lacked the kind of sophisticated equipment necessary to do the job right, and the siege
[17:04 --> 17:09] of Philopopolis, like the siege of Nicopolis, took longer than it was supposed to, and while
[17:09 --> 17:14] the Romans regained their strength, Knieve saw the strength of his own army slowly slipping
[17:14 --> 17:21] away. But eventually, the citizens of Philopopolis could hold out no longer, and they were forced
[17:21 --> 17:28] to surrender their city. In the subsequent sack, it is reported that 100,000 men, women,
[17:28 --> 17:35] and children were killed. Knieve emboldened, then grabbed Titus Julius Priscus, the governor
[17:35 --> 17:40] of Thrace, who may or may not have been in on the whole thing, and been the one who betrayed
[17:40 --> 17:45] Philopopolis to the Goths, and proclaimed Priscus emperor of the Roman Empire under
[17:45 --> 17:52] the generous protection of the Gothic king. This attempt to seize the empire in one fell
[17:52 --> 17:56] swoop was short-lived, though. Not only did Priscus die shortly after becoming emperor
[17:56 --> 18:02] – cause of death unknown – but Theseus and his reinvigorated army arrived on the
[18:02 --> 18:08] scene and slowly began to surround the Gothic position. Aware that the siege had depleted
[18:08 --> 18:14] his forces dangerously, Knieve decided it was time for the Goths to make their getaway.
[18:14 --> 18:22] They piled their carts high with accumulated treasure and made a run for the northern border.
[18:22 --> 18:26] Confident both in his numerical superiority, and just the superiority of the legions in
[18:26 --> 18:32] general, Theseus chased down the fleeing Goths and made every effort to fight them as soon
[18:32 --> 18:37] as possible. A decisive battle would prove to the Goths that messing with Rome got you
[18:37 --> 18:43] nowhere, and would prove to the Romans themselves that the dominance of the legions was still
[18:43 --> 18:49] a matter of fact, not a matter of imagined reputation. But boy did he wind up proving
[18:49 --> 18:55] just the opposite. The mistake Theseus made was that he was so
[18:55 --> 19:00] eager to engage the Goths that he basically seeded the decision of where the battle would
[19:00 --> 19:06] take place to Knieve. The Gothic king chose a spot just south of the Danube near the town
[19:06 --> 19:12] of Abertus and arranged his men in three lines, strategically positioning the third line just
[19:12 --> 19:17] behind some marshy swampland so that the front Gothic ranks kept the site screened
[19:17 --> 19:23] from the Romans. I won't say that the battle was already decided before the first spear
[19:23 --> 19:30] was tossed, but allowing Knieve to pick the time and place of the battle was a fatal blunder.
[19:30 --> 19:36] Remember kids, if there is one thing the history of warfare has proven again and again, it's
[19:37 --> 19:43] like real estate, the name of the game is location, location, location. Don't let your
[19:43 --> 19:49] enemy pick the battle site. Chances are the spot he will pick is a spot that complements
[19:49 --> 19:55] his strengths and negates yours. If he offers battle someplace you're not sure of, avoid
[19:55 --> 20:01] the temptation to fight it out, and instead focus on drawing him into a spot of your choosing.
[20:02 --> 20:11] I can promise you, you will like the results a whole lot better. Just ask Theseus.
[20:11 --> 20:15] According to legend, the battle of Abertus started ominously for the Romans, as Heranius
[20:15 --> 20:22] was struck by an arrow and killed in the opening minutes of the fight. Theseus, however, used
[20:22 --> 20:28] the shocking death of his son as a way to rally his men. Crying out, let no one mourn,
[20:28 --> 20:34] the death of one soldier is no great loss to the Republic. This stirring scene is of
[20:34 --> 20:38] course apocryphal, but I figured I'd pass it along since that was the way the Romans
[20:38 --> 20:45] told the story to each other. Regardless, the moment was soon forgotten as the legions
[20:45 --> 20:53] plunged into the damp hell that awaited them in front of that third gothic line. The legions
[20:53 --> 20:58] pushed the Goths back, and pushed the Goths back, and pushed the Goths back, leaving
[20:58 --> 21:04] the Romans with the impression that the battle was now going great. The first gothic line
[21:04 --> 21:08] broke and then the second gave way, and the Romans pursued the fleeing barbarians with
[21:08 --> 21:15] reckless abandon, sure that victory was just within their grasp. But the legions pursued
[21:15 --> 21:22] the fleeing Goths right into the marshlands and right into Canoeva's trap. Bogged down
[21:22 --> 21:28] in the marsh, the Romans were surrounded by the last gothic line. Fierce combat followed,
[21:28 --> 21:32] but the terrain was too much for the Romans to overcome, and the battle turned into a
[21:32 --> 21:38] slaughter. Theseus himself disappeared in the fighting, and his body was never recovered
[21:38 --> 21:47] from the swamp. He was fifty years old, and had ruled the empire for two years.
[21:47 --> 21:52] The governor of Upper Moesia, a general named Trebonianus Gallus, was left in command of
[21:52 --> 21:59] the remnants of the Roman army, and soon after the battle, he negotiated a peace with Canoeva.
[21:59 --> 22:03] The Goths would be allowed to leave Roman territory unmolested, with all the treasure
[22:03 --> 22:07] they had accumulated, which, yeah, it's not like the Romans could have stopped Canoeva
[22:07 --> 22:12] from doing anything he wanted anyway. But the Roman general also worked out a deal that
[22:12 --> 22:17] would pay Canoeva an annual tribute in exchange for the gothic king agreeing to stay out of
[22:17 --> 22:24] Roman territory. This last bit became the source of a later rumor that Gallus had actually
[22:24 --> 22:29] conspired with Canoeva before the battle to ensure a Roman defeat. But given all the other
[22:29 --> 22:34] circumstances of the battle and his later conduct, there is no reason to believe that
[22:34 --> 22:42] Gallus had anything at all to do with the defeat at Abrittus.
[22:42 --> 22:46] The battle of Abrittus was one of the most shocking setbacks in Roman history. Though
[22:46 --> 22:52] not quite as existentially terrifying as Canoeva, the results of the battle still came as a
[22:52 --> 22:59] mortal shock to the folks back home. The emperor was dead? His army destroyed? Who or what
[22:59 --> 23:01] is going to protect us now?
[23:01 --> 23:07] Theseus had set out to prove that the Romans were still the biggest kid on the block, and
[23:07 --> 23:12] had wound up proving exactly the opposite. And this new gothic terror filled the Romans
[23:12 --> 23:17] with the dread they had not really felt since the days of Hannibal. How are we going to
[23:17 --> 23:23] survive if our supposedly invincible legions are so easily destroyed?
[23:23 --> 23:27] There was no ready answer, and the citizens of the empire began to live with a fear in
[23:27 --> 23:33] their hearts that they had never experienced before. Really, at that moment, it did not
[23:33 --> 23:38] seem like the end was that far off.
[23:38 --> 23:43] I want to end this week with a quick note on the tours. The first trip, as I already
[23:43 --> 23:49] mentioned is sold out, but we do have some space available on trips 2 and 3, which will
[23:49 --> 23:57] run from May 17 to May 26, and from May 28 to June 7 respectively. It will be exactly
[23:57 --> 24:02] the same itinerary, just over a different span of days, so if the first set of dates
[24:02 --> 24:06] didn't work out for you, or you thought you had already missed your chance to go,
[24:06 --> 24:10] then by all means, come along on one of the other trips.
[24:10 --> 24:16] I should also note that we have removed the transatlantic airfare from the tour package.
[24:16 --> 24:20] Once we started to get a feel for what would work out best for everyone, especially since
[24:20 --> 24:25] so many international travelers will be along, it became obvious that the airfare to Rome
[24:25 --> 24:30] and from Istanbul was more of a hindrance than a help to most people, so we made the
[24:30 --> 24:36] decision to drop that part of the package. We will by all means help everyone make the
[24:36 --> 24:42] proper arrangements, but just know that the price you see no longer includes those tickets.
[24:42 --> 24:49] So, TheHistoryOfRomeTour.com. Act now, because, as they say, good seats are still available,
[24:50 --> 24:51] but won't be forever.

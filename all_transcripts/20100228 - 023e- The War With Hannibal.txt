[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 23E, The War with Hannibal.
[00:13 --> 00:18] Though neither side was aware of it, the long war between Rome and Carthage was marching
[00:18 --> 00:20] inexorably towards a final conclusion.
[00:20 --> 00:25] For the Romans, the scourge of Hannibal seemed a virus they would never be able to purge
[00:25 --> 00:26] from their body.
[00:27 --> 00:32] Not strong enough to conquer the Romans, yet too strong to just be driven off, Hannibal
[00:32 --> 00:37] had wrecked havoc in Italy for a decade and there was no indication he would ever leave.
[00:38 --> 00:43] The Fabian strategy of countering Hannibal's political moves without risking open battle
[00:43 --> 00:45] was by now firmly entrenched.
[00:46 --> 00:50] Even those commanders who broke from this tradition found themselves chasing after
[00:50 --> 00:51] a ghost.
[00:52 --> 00:56] Hannibal would never fight a battle not of his own devising and stayed forever one
[00:56 --> 00:58] step ahead of Roman pursuit.
[01:01 --> 01:04] Hannibal himself knew that things could not go on like this forever.
[01:05 --> 01:08] The Carthaginian Senate was growing weary of the war.
[01:09 --> 01:13] Supplies and reinforcements were produced in ever-shrinking amounts after ever more
[01:13 --> 01:14] cajoling.
[01:15 --> 01:19] If things kept going in this direction, Hannibal would find himself isolated in
[01:19 --> 01:22] enemy territory abandoned by his country.
[01:23 --> 01:27] It was fast turning into a replay of his father's war in Sicily.
[01:27 --> 01:29] Hannibal could see the writing on the wall.
[01:30 --> 01:34] He did not have the money or manpower to launch a decisive offensive, even if the
[01:34 --> 01:39] shell-shocked Romans still went to bed in fear of the Carthaginian army pouring
[01:39 --> 01:40] through the gates while they slept.
[01:42 --> 01:47] But entering 207 BC, the 11th year since Hannibal had left New Carthage for Italy,
[01:47 --> 01:52] the Carthaginian commander still had hope of a successful conclusion.
[01:53 --> 01:58] His brother Hasdrubal had left Spain after tangling with young Scipio and was
[01:58 --> 02:02] making his way across Gaul through the Alps and would soon be in Italy with an
[02:02 --> 02:03] army of 30,000.
[02:04 --> 02:09] If the two brothers were able to link up, they would form an army that could
[02:09 --> 02:11] overrun anything the Romans sent against them.
[02:13 --> 02:16] The Romans were not ignorant of the threat they faced from this second
[02:16 --> 02:17] invading army.
[02:18 --> 02:22] When Hasdrubal passed into the Po Valley, he was immediately shadowed by two Roman
[02:22 --> 02:26] legions led by one of the consuls for the year, Marcus Livius.
[02:28 --> 02:31] Livius kept to the high ground, not having enough troops to openly
[02:31 --> 02:36] confront Hasdrubal, but hoping to at least forestall the Carthaginians if
[02:36 --> 02:37] they attempted to move further south.
[02:39 --> 02:43] Hasdrubal, knowing there was no army in the area who could match him,
[02:43 --> 02:47] moved confidently through the Italian countryside, picking up Gallic allies
[02:47 --> 02:50] and waiting for word from his brother on where to meet up.
[02:52 --> 02:56] The other consul for the year, Gaius Claudius Nero, was in camp with his
[02:56 --> 03:00] army some 250 miles south, keeping watch on Hannibal.
[03:02 --> 03:06] He knew that neither his army nor Livius's in the north could halt the
[03:06 --> 03:10] movement of the Carthaginian armies they each shadowed, only if they were
[03:10 --> 03:14] able to concentrate Roman force against one or the other, who they
[03:14 --> 03:17] hoped to prevent the disaster of a combined Carthaginian army.
[03:19 --> 03:23] So Nero made a snap decision and embarked on an incredibly risky
[03:23 --> 03:23] adventure.
[03:25 --> 03:28] Leaving a token force in camp to keep up appearances, he ordered the
[03:28 --> 03:32] bulk of his army out in the middle of the night and force marched them
[03:32 --> 03:37] north to link up with Livius and hopefully annihilate Hasdrubal before
[03:37 --> 03:38] Hannibal caught wind of the plan.
[03:40 --> 03:45] Roman luck held and Nero was able to close the 250-mile gap in a mere
[03:45 --> 03:49] seven days, with his troops left behind tending multiple fires and
[03:49 --> 03:52] manning round-the-clock guard duty so Hannibal would believe a full
[03:52 --> 03:54] Roman army was still encamped.
[03:56 --> 03:59] Nero linked up with Livius and marched his troops into his
[03:59 --> 04:00] colleague's camp at night.
[04:01 --> 04:05] Though the Romans tried to keep this arrival secret, word soon
[04:05 --> 04:09] leaked to Hasdrubal of the numerically superior enemy he now faced, and
[04:09 --> 04:13] he attempted to withdraw, making his way along the Mataris River.
[04:14 --> 04:18] The two consular armies took off at once in pursuit and were soon
[04:18 --> 04:21] able to trap Hasdrubal's tired army against the river.
[04:22 --> 04:25] The battle that followed turned from an equal engagement into a route
[04:25 --> 04:28] when Nero led a portion of his troops around behind the
[04:28 --> 04:30] Carthaginians and surprised their rear.
[04:32 --> 04:35] Hasdrubal, knowing the end was near, charged out into the
[04:35 --> 04:37] middle of the battle and died fighting.
[04:38 --> 04:41] The hope of a Carthaginian super army died there on the banks of the
[04:41 --> 04:42] Mataris.
[04:42 --> 04:46] Hannibal's last best hope to conquer the Romans died with it.
[04:47 --> 04:49] The Romans were ecstatic at the news.
[04:49 --> 04:53] It was the first major battle in Italy the Romans had actually won.
[04:53 --> 04:57] And to young Scipio, returning from his command in Spain, word
[04:57 --> 04:59] of the victory was music to his ears.
[05:00 --> 05:03] The high spirits of his countrymen and low threat level now posed
[05:03 --> 05:07] by Hannibal produced the exact psychological environment Scipio
[05:07 --> 05:11] needed to ensure a receptive audience for his plan of a North
[05:11 --> 05:11] African invasion.
[05:13 --> 05:18] In 205 BC, Scipio went before the Senate and pitched his idea.
[05:18 --> 05:22] The time had come, he argued, to return to the original
[05:22 --> 05:24] strategy abandoned at the outset of the war.
[05:25 --> 05:27] The fight had to be taken to the Carthaginians.
[05:28 --> 05:30] Hannibal would not be driven off by direct action.
[05:31 --> 05:34] The only way to be rid of him was to attack Carthage and force the
[05:34 --> 05:38] Carthaginian Senate to recall Hannibal to protect the mother city.
[05:40 --> 05:43] But Scipio was not without detractors in the Senate, chief
[05:43 --> 05:46] amongst them old Marcus Fabius, now 70 years old.
[05:47 --> 05:50] What Scipio pitched was the exact opposite of everything Fabius
[05:50 --> 05:51] stood for.
[05:52 --> 05:55] The old war horse argued that with Hasdrubal's defeat, the
[05:55 --> 05:59] Romans should stick with the limited objective of re-securing
[05:59 --> 06:02] the Po Valley and continuing the war of attrition against
[06:02 --> 06:05] Hannibal, that though lacking the flash of Scipio's bold
[06:05 --> 06:07] plan had proved so successful.
[06:09 --> 06:12] Generational tensions played out, with Scipio accusing old
[06:12 --> 06:16] Fabius of being too cautious and stuck in his ways, and
[06:16 --> 06:19] Fabius reminding young Scipio that had it not been for
[06:19 --> 06:21] caution, Rome would have fallen a decade earlier.
[06:22 --> 06:26] But the aura of Scipio carried the day, and with
[06:26 --> 06:29] reservations attached, he was more or less given the go-ahead
[06:29 --> 06:30] for his invasion.
[06:32 --> 06:34] The young Roman general embarked for Sicily, where he
[06:34 --> 06:37] began to make his preparations, building a fleet
[06:37 --> 06:38] and gathering troops.
[06:39 --> 06:42] Of vital importance was a mission he assigned to
[06:42 --> 06:45] Lelius, the naval commander who had been in Scipio's
[06:45 --> 06:47] confidence at the siege of New Carthage.
[06:49 --> 06:51] The most formidable part of the Carthaginian army,
[06:51 --> 06:53] everyone knew, was the Numidian cavalry.
[06:54 --> 06:58] They could not be matched in speed or skill, and as long as
[06:58 --> 07:01] they remained in the opposing line, the legions would always
[07:01 --> 07:02] be in danger.
[07:03 --> 07:06] Scipio knew something of North African politics, though,
[07:06 --> 07:08] and hoped to turn a clear weakness into an advantage.
[07:10 --> 07:13] Lelius's mission was to sail to North Africa and turn the
[07:13 --> 07:14] Numidians to the Roman side.
[07:16 --> 07:18] The Numidians, you must understand, were not
[07:18 --> 07:19] Carthaginians.
[07:19 --> 07:22] They were a client state of Carthage, and had long chafed
[07:22 --> 07:24] under Carthaginian rule.
[07:25 --> 07:27] Though the leadership seemed more or less content to stick
[07:27 --> 07:29] with Carthage, there was an undercurrent of
[07:29 --> 07:31] dissatisfaction that always threatened
[07:31 --> 07:32] to come to the surface.
[07:33 --> 07:36] In North Africa, Lelius made contact with the exiled
[07:36 --> 07:40] Numidian prince, Massinissa, who had fought against
[07:40 --> 07:43] Scipio in Spain, and confirmed that he was ready
[07:43 --> 07:46] and willing to lead his followers in revolt, both
[07:46 --> 07:48] against his own king and the Carthaginians.
[07:49 --> 07:52] In the years to come, Massinissa would remain a
[07:52 --> 07:55] staunch ally of Rome, matching in many ways the
[07:55 --> 07:56] friendship of Hiro.
[07:56 --> 07:59] Certainly in longevity, a young man at the time of the
[07:59 --> 08:03] Second Punic War, Massinissa would reign over Numidia for
[08:03 --> 08:06] 50 years, nipping in the bud any trouble posed to the
[08:06 --> 08:07] Romans from Africa.
[08:09 --> 08:13] Scipio sailed from North Africa in 203 BC with a
[08:13 --> 08:15] force of about 35,000.
[08:15 --> 08:18] His aim was to end the war or die trying.
[08:19 --> 08:22] When the Romans landed, they immediately swept through
[08:22 --> 08:24] the land west of Carthage, taking prisoners
[08:24 --> 08:26] and sacking towns.
[08:27 --> 08:30] Scipio had his eye on the major city of Utica, and in
[08:30 --> 08:33] the autumn of 203, he besieged the city.
[08:34 --> 08:36] The Carthaginians sent a massive army against
[08:36 --> 08:39] Scipio, reportedly in excess of 70,000 troops,
[08:40 --> 08:41] to drive the Romans off.
[08:42 --> 08:48] Scipio prudently withdrew, and to throw the
[08:49 --> 08:52] While the talks commenced though, Scipio scouted his
[08:52 --> 08:55] enemy and formulated a plan to beat them without
[08:55 --> 08:57] having to take the field against a far larger army.
[08:59 --> 09:02] The fake talks concluded, Scipio sent a portion of
[09:02 --> 09:05] his troops back to Utica to feign a return to the
[09:05 --> 09:05] siege.
[09:06 --> 09:08] However, while the unsuspecting Carthaginians
[09:08 --> 09:11] slept, content to arise the next morning and
[09:11 --> 09:14] overwhelm the Roman pest, Scipio dispatched the
[09:14 --> 09:16] bulk of his army towards the enemy camp.
[09:17 --> 09:20] Under cover of darkness, they started fires all over
[09:20 --> 09:22] the camp and waited by the exits.
[09:24 --> 09:26] The alarm was raised, and when the panicked soldiers
[09:26 --> 09:28] came pouring out of the gates, they were
[09:28 --> 09:29] slaughtered by the Romans.
[09:31 --> 09:33] Those who were not killed by the Romans died
[09:33 --> 09:33] in the fire.
[09:34 --> 09:37] It was a horrible and bloody affair, but just
[09:37 --> 09:39] like that, Scipio had destroyed most of the
[09:39 --> 09:41] Carthaginian army in North Africa.
[09:42 --> 09:45] The Carthaginians regrouped however, and made
[09:45 --> 09:48] one last go of it, but at a place called Great
[09:48 --> 09:50] Plains, Scipio routed them, and Carthage found
[09:50 --> 09:53] itself suddenly without an army in the field,
[09:53 --> 09:55] not unlike the Romans had found themselves
[09:55 --> 09:57] after Cannae so many years before.
[09:58 --> 10:00] At this point, the Carthaginian Senate was
[10:00 --> 10:01] left with no choice.
[10:02 --> 10:04] Hannibal had to be recalled.
[10:06 --> 10:08] Envoys were sent to Italy in 202 to
[10:08 --> 10:09] bring him back.
[10:09 --> 10:12] With tears streaming from his one good eye,
[10:12 --> 10:14] Hannibal reluctantly ordered his army to board
[10:14 --> 10:16] the ship sent to retrieve them.
[10:17 --> 10:19] After 16 years, the death of his brothers,
[10:20 --> 10:22] and an endless series of maneuvers designed
[10:22 --> 10:24] to bring the Romans to their knees, he was
[10:24 --> 10:26] being pulled out of Italy no closer to his
[10:26 --> 10:28] goal than when he started.
[10:29 --> 10:30] His life's work had been for naught.
[10:32 --> 10:34] It was an exhausted and psychologically wounded
[10:34 --> 10:36] Hannibal who returned to North Africa.
[10:37 --> 10:39] He would fight bravely there, and no
[10:39 --> 10:41] historian fault any of the decisions he made
[10:41 --> 10:43] while battling Scipio.
[10:44 --> 10:46] But clearly, the imaginative genius who had
[10:46 --> 10:49] so flummoxed the Romans early in the war was gone.
[10:50 --> 10:52] All the vital energy was in the confident
[10:52 --> 10:55] hands of Scipio, and both of them seemed to know it.
[10:57 --> 10:59] After his victories near the coast, and with
[10:59 --> 11:01] the knowledge of Hannibal's return,
[11:01 --> 11:04] Scipio did not make for Carthage, but
[11:04 --> 11:05] rather marched inland.
[11:06 --> 11:08] The interior of North Africa was hostile
[11:08 --> 11:10] territory, not just for the Romans, but
[11:10 --> 11:12] for the Carthaginians as well.
[11:13 --> 11:16] The land was populated with subject people of
[11:16 --> 11:19] dubious Carthaginian loyalty, but nonetheless,
[11:19 --> 11:21] they were a critical source of supplies for the city.
[11:23 --> 11:25] Scipio hoped to draw Hannibal into unfriendly
[11:25 --> 11:28] territory by threatening Carthage with starvation.
[11:30 --> 11:32] Hannibal himself despaired at the situation.
[11:33 --> 11:35] He had to make a move against Scipio,
[11:35 --> 11:37] but the troops he had at his disposal
[11:37 --> 11:39] were not even close to a match for the Romans.
[11:40 --> 11:43] He had his corps of veterans, but the rest
[11:43 --> 11:47] were recent recruits, ill-trained and passionless.
[11:48 --> 11:50] He argued against leading such a weak army out,
[11:51 --> 11:53] but was overruled by the Senate, who ordered
[11:53 --> 11:55] him to track down Scipio and defeat him,
[11:55 --> 11:57] and always the good soldier.
[11:58 --> 11:59] Hannibal did as he was told.
[12:01 --> 12:03] The two armies met at Zama,
[12:03 --> 12:05] a hundred or so miles southwest of Carthage.
[12:06 --> 12:08] Prior to any armed confrontation,
[12:08 --> 12:10] the two great generals met.
[12:11 --> 12:14] Hannibal attempted to secure a favorable peace,
[12:14 --> 12:16] knowing his own troops were ill-equipped
[12:16 --> 12:19] to deal with the Romans, but Scipio would have none of it.
[12:20 --> 12:22] After acknowledging the respect each had for the other,
[12:23 --> 12:24] they departed back to their own tents
[12:24 --> 12:26] to prepare for the final battle.
[12:29 --> 12:31] Lining up in the morning, Hannibal placed
[12:31 --> 12:33] his raw recruits in the front line,
[12:33 --> 12:34] with his veterans behind.
[12:35 --> 12:37] This way, the new troops would have no place
[12:37 --> 12:39] to run if they tried to retreat,
[12:39 --> 12:41] and if Hannibal was lucky,
[12:41 --> 12:43] they would tire the legionaries out
[12:43 --> 12:46] and allow the Carthaginian veterans to sweep through.
[12:47 --> 12:49] He also placed his war elephants,
[12:49 --> 12:51] the old Carthaginian juggernaut,
[12:51 --> 12:52] at the head of the army.
[12:53 --> 12:55] But Scipio was well-prepared for the elephants
[12:55 --> 12:57] and positioned his men so that lanes were open
[12:57 --> 12:59] all the way through the lines.
[12:59 --> 13:02] When the elephants charged, they passed by harmlessly.
[13:04 --> 13:05] The battle begun.
[13:05 --> 13:07] Rome scored a victory that had eluded them
[13:07 --> 13:08] the entire war.
[13:09 --> 13:11] Masinissa's allied Numidian cavalry
[13:11 --> 13:14] was able to drive off their Carthaginian counterparts,
[13:14 --> 13:15] suddenly leaving Hannibal,
[13:15 --> 13:17] rather than the Romans, without support.
[13:19 --> 13:20] Just as he predicted,
[13:20 --> 13:23] the experienced Romans cut through Hannibal's new soldiers.
[13:24 --> 13:25] But a total rout was prevented
[13:25 --> 13:27] by the strength of his veterans
[13:27 --> 13:29] who blunted the Romans' advance.
[13:30 --> 13:31] The war hung in the balance
[13:31 --> 13:33] as two of the greatest strategic
[13:33 --> 13:36] and tactical geniuses in history
[13:36 --> 13:39] oversaw an unimaginative clash of brute force.
[13:40 --> 13:42] When the Roman cavalry returned
[13:42 --> 13:43] to attack the Carthaginian rear,
[13:44 --> 13:46] the battle turned decisively against Hannibal.
[13:46 --> 13:48] His army was broken
[13:48 --> 13:49] and the great Carthaginian general
[13:49 --> 13:51] was forced to withdraw and defeat.
[13:52 --> 13:54] The Battle of Zama was over.
[13:54 --> 13:57] So too was the Second Punic War.
[13:58 --> 14:00] Carthage offered no further resistance
[14:00 --> 14:02] and accepted punishing terms.
[14:03 --> 14:06] While allowed to keep possessions in North Africa,
[14:06 --> 14:09] the dream of a Carthaginian empire overseas was crushed
[14:09 --> 14:11] and all holdings forfeited to the Romans.
[14:12 --> 14:15] Carthage was not allowed to equip an army or a navy,
[14:16 --> 14:18] nor allowed to engage in any hostilities
[14:18 --> 14:20] with their neighbors without explicit Roman permission.
[14:22 --> 14:25] For his loyalty, Masinissa was granted control
[14:25 --> 14:27] over an independent Numidian kingdom
[14:27 --> 14:28] that would be the dominant force
[14:28 --> 14:30] in North Africa for years to come.
[14:32 --> 14:35] Finally, a huge punitive fine was laid on Carthage
[14:35 --> 14:37] to be paid off in no less than 50 years.
[14:39 --> 14:41] In a final irony, it was Hannibal
[14:41 --> 14:43] who put a stop to any call for further resistance
[14:43 --> 14:46] and demanded that the Senate accept Roman terms.
[14:47 --> 14:48] Carthage was defeated.
[14:48 --> 14:51] There was nothing left to be said about it.
[14:52 --> 14:55] The Romans had paid an enormous price for their victory.
[14:56 --> 14:59] The population of Rome declined by something like 17%
[14:59 --> 15:00] over the course of the war,
[15:01 --> 15:02] and the treasury was all but empty.
[15:03 --> 15:06] But they had won an immeasurably valuable prize,
[15:07 --> 15:10] uncontested control of the entire Western Mediterranean.
[15:11 --> 15:13] The Roman Empire as we now know it,
[15:13 --> 15:15] the greatest power in the ancient world
[15:15 --> 15:18] and one of the farthest reaching land empires in history
[15:18 --> 15:21] was born on that day at Zama in 202 BC.
[15:23 --> 15:25] Some also claim, as I said at the outset
[15:25 --> 15:26] of this series of episodes,
[15:26 --> 15:28] that the victory over Carthage
[15:28 --> 15:31] also marked the death of old Roman virtue.
[15:33 --> 15:36] Certainly, there's much to be said for the theory
[15:36 --> 15:38] that the Republic was not long for this world
[15:38 --> 15:40] after Rome lost its greatest enemy.
[15:41 --> 15:42] Over the course of the war,
[15:42 --> 15:44] the power of the Senate had grown
[15:44 --> 15:46] to far exceed the people's assemblies,
[15:46 --> 15:49] and democracy, such as it had existed,
[15:49 --> 15:50] was a thing of the past.
[15:51 --> 15:54] The Republic was now a true aristocratic oligarchy.
[15:55 --> 15:57] The Senate was firmly in control of Rome
[15:57 --> 15:59] and would be for the rest of the life of the Republic.
[16:01 --> 16:04] But soon, the egos of the foremost families in Rome
[16:04 --> 16:06] began to grow unchecked,
[16:06 --> 16:08] and men emerged every day
[16:08 --> 16:10] who had no truck with the old restraint
[16:10 --> 16:12] shown by their forefathers.
[16:13 --> 16:15] Scipio had inadvertently introduced
[16:15 --> 16:16] the cult of personality to the Romans,
[16:17 --> 16:19] and the coming age of troubles
[16:19 --> 16:21] would revolve around powerful men
[16:21 --> 16:22] who put their own ambition
[16:22 --> 16:25] above that of some withered sense of propriety.
[16:26 --> 16:30] The Grokai brothers, Marius, Sulla, Julius Caesar,
[16:30 --> 16:32] Pompey, and finally Augustus,
[16:32 --> 16:35] would drive Roman politics in the coming years.
[16:36 --> 16:38] They took their cues from Scipio,
[16:38 --> 16:40] who was nearly deified in his lifetime,
[16:41 --> 16:43] rather than the string of forgotten consuls
[16:43 --> 16:45] who preserved tradition in anonymity.
[16:46 --> 16:49] Further, these latter-day Roman leaders
[16:49 --> 16:50] never dealt with the humility
[16:50 --> 16:52] of facing an external threat
[16:52 --> 16:54] that checked their boundless egos.
[16:55 --> 16:58] Control of Rome now meant control of the whole world.
[16:59 --> 17:00] What chance did the Republic have
[17:00 --> 17:03] when absolute power was at stake?
[17:06 --> 17:08] I will be out of town next week,
[17:08 --> 17:09] so we will leave the Romans here
[17:09 --> 17:11] at the moment of their greatest triumph.
[17:13 --> 17:15] Next time, in two weeks,
[17:15 --> 17:17] we will enter a new era of Roman history
[17:17 --> 17:21] as Rome looks east to the great civilizations of Greece.
[17:22 --> 17:24] Contact with Greece would forever alter
[17:24 --> 17:25] the character of the Romans,
[17:25 --> 17:27] as they were introduced to the luxury,
[17:27 --> 17:30] philosophy, art, and science of the East.
[17:31 --> 17:33] The marriage of East and West
[17:33 --> 17:34] would be proposed on the battlefield,
[17:35 --> 17:36] but it would be consummated
[17:36 --> 17:38] in the minds of the victorious Romans,
[17:38 --> 17:40] who became open to ideas
[17:40 --> 17:42] that would have made their frugal
[17:42 --> 17:44] and virtuous ancestors shudder.

[00:39 --> 00:44] This week, I'm going to recommend picking up Roman Lives by Plutarch, which goes
[00:44 --> 00:48] back a bit in time from where we are, but definitely was a source for information
[00:48 --> 00:53] on Cicero, Julius Caesar, Marc Antony, and many other of our old friends.
[00:53 --> 00:58] Just remember to go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash rome so that they know who sent you.
[01:04 --> 01:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, episode 62, Take My Wife, Please.
[01:14 --> 01:18] In the uncertain days after the assassination of Caligula, the people of Rome must have
[01:18 --> 01:22] wondered whether or not they had now actually seen the worst the imperial
[01:22 --> 01:23] dynasty could throw at them.
[01:23 --> 01:27] They had, after all, thought the worst was behind them once before, after
[01:27 --> 01:31] Tiberius, who had spent the last half of his reign as a paranoid recluse.
[01:32 --> 01:36] But everyone soon realized that Caligula was a debauched madman who just took
[01:36 --> 01:40] everything that made Tiberius' final years unbearable and times them by 10.
[01:41 --> 01:44] So when Caligula was murdered, it is understandable that the Romans were a
[01:44 --> 01:46] bit gun shy about their next emperor.
[01:47 --> 01:53] As the saying goes, fool me once, shame on you, fool me, we can't get
[01:53 --> 01:54] fooled again.
[01:55 --> 01:58] So they held their collective breath as they waited for word from the Senate to
[01:58 --> 02:01] come about who would be the empire's next princeps.
[02:01 --> 02:04] It can't possibly be worse than Caligula, can it?
[02:05 --> 02:10] When word came that it would be Claudius, yes, Uncle Claudius, they must have
[02:10 --> 02:12] let go their breath with a deflated sigh.
[02:13 --> 02:16] How interesting, it actually can get worse.
[02:17 --> 02:21] We went from a cruel old pervert to a raving madman, and now we are left
[02:21 --> 02:24] with nothing more than a blubbering idiot.
[02:24 --> 02:28] Truly we have combed the far reaches of our mighty empire and drawn from the
[02:28 --> 02:32] ranks of our citizen body, the finest and most able men to rule over us.
[02:33 --> 02:36] Uncle Claudius, sweet Jupiter, let's go get a drink.
[02:38 --> 02:41] But once they had turned their backs in disgust, a funny thing happened.
[02:42 --> 02:45] Claudius turned out to be not so bad, pretty good even.
[02:45 --> 02:48] Did you hear that the campaigns in Britain are going well?
[02:48 --> 02:51] That Claudius has successfully established a whole new province.
[02:51 --> 02:53] Have you seen the new roads?
[02:53 --> 02:54] They're not half bad.
[02:54 --> 02:59] I was in court the other day and Claudius not only presided over cases, but his
[02:59 --> 03:01] judgments were measured and reasonable.
[03:01 --> 03:05] I even saw him ignore the prescribed penalties after a man had been found
[03:05 --> 03:09] guilty because, no, no, hear me out, because justice demanded it.
[03:09 --> 03:12] I know, justice, damnedest thing I've ever seen.
[03:13 --> 03:16] They always said Claudius was a stuttering fool and that may well be,
[03:16 --> 03:19] but Emperor Claudius seems like a pretty good egg.
[03:20 --> 03:23] I should pause here for a second and address something that popped up
[03:23 --> 03:25] in the comment thread last week.
[03:26 --> 03:28] Veronica was wondering if she had missed the part where suddenly the
[03:28 --> 03:32] Romans switched and began referring to their rulers as emperors rather
[03:32 --> 03:34] than princeps as Augustus had preferred.
[03:35 --> 03:39] The answer is that, well, no, technically you didn't miss that part.
[03:39 --> 03:43] The title emperor is used commonly by historians to label the rulers of
[03:43 --> 03:47] the Roman empire after the ascent of Augustus, but the Romans themselves
[03:47 --> 03:51] used a number of different titles for the man at the top, including
[03:51 --> 03:53] princeps, Augustus, and simply Caesar.
[03:54 --> 03:58] The technical meeting of Imperator still carried with it a martial
[03:58 --> 04:02] connotation, and in fact, when Claudius ascended to the throne, he
[04:02 --> 04:06] refused the Imperator honorific because he had done nothing to earn it.
[04:07 --> 04:10] Not that he didn't want it, just that he felt a little awkward being
[04:10 --> 04:13] hailed as a great commander when the closest he had ever gotten to a
[04:13 --> 04:15] battle was reading about it in a book.
[04:15 --> 04:19] Part of the rationale behind the invasion of Britain was to earn the
[04:19 --> 04:21] street cred he would need to actually accept the title.
[04:22 --> 04:26] After Claudius, the honorific Imperator was accepted and not
[04:26 --> 04:31] accepted or more accurately granted and not granted depending on the
[04:31 --> 04:35] man in question, but eventually the title did simply become hereditary
[04:35 --> 04:38] and thus we have come to refer to the whole lot of them as
[04:38 --> 04:41] emperor, regardless of whether or not they had technically been awarded
[04:41 --> 04:43] the title Imperator or not.
[04:43 --> 04:47] The reality of how power was consolidated and legitimized during
[04:47 --> 04:50] this period is far more complicated than a man simply becoming
[04:50 --> 04:54] emperor the way a man becomes a king, but the effect wound up
[04:54 --> 04:55] being basically the same.
[04:56 --> 04:59] So historians shorthand the whole convoluted mess into a single
[04:59 --> 05:01] title and that title is emperor.
[05:02 --> 05:05] So following convention, I have found myself calling these men
[05:05 --> 05:08] emperors, even though the Romans themselves did not use the
[05:08 --> 05:10] word the same way we do.
[05:10 --> 05:13] I would say that it falls under the category of generally
[05:13 --> 05:16] accepted principles and practices, not technically accurate,
[05:17 --> 05:20] but acceptably descriptive enough for auditing purposes.
[05:22 --> 05:25] So we left off last week with Claudius overseeing the
[05:25 --> 05:28] successful conclusion of what would prove to be merely the
[05:28 --> 05:30] first phase of the Roman invasion of Britain.
[05:31 --> 05:34] General Plotius had become governor Plotius and he
[05:34 --> 05:36] set about quickly and efficiently absorbing the
[05:36 --> 05:39] conquered portions of Southeast Britannia into the empire.
[05:40 --> 05:43] Usually there was a waiting period after territory is targeted
[05:43 --> 05:47] for integration by the Romans, during which a local client
[05:47 --> 05:49] monarch rules as an ally of Rome.
[05:49 --> 05:51] But there was no beating around the bush in Britain.
[05:52 --> 05:55] As soon as the Romans had a foothold, they began direct administration.
[05:57 --> 06:00] Not that that foothold was at times anything more than a foothold, mind you.
[06:01 --> 06:03] It would take until the end of the century before the
[06:03 --> 06:06] rest of the island was pacified in any meaningful way.
[06:06 --> 06:09] And even then, their dominance only extended so far north.
[06:10 --> 06:14] The emperor Hadrian finally decided to simply build a wall rather than make a
[06:14 --> 06:18] play at conquering the truly crazy barbarians up in the highlands of the far north.
[06:19 --> 06:22] There's a funny line I heard about that once that I've always remembered,
[06:22 --> 06:26] even though I have no idea who said it, that went something like,
[06:26 --> 06:29] Hadrian decided to build his wall so the Scots would be left undisturbed
[06:29 --> 06:33] in their never ending war against their mortal enemies, the Scots.
[06:34 --> 06:38] Which I think sums up the whole situation nicely, but I'm getting ahead of myself.
[06:39 --> 06:43] Claudius remained as governor until 47 and spent the majority of his time and
[06:43 --> 06:47] energy consolidating the Roman position, building veteran settlements and
[06:47 --> 06:50] getting the locals to fall in line with his new tax policies.
[06:51 --> 06:55] When Claudius was replaced by Osterius Scappola, though, the new governor
[06:55 --> 06:57] decided to push west into Wales.
[06:59 --> 07:02] The fugitive British leader, Coraticus, had fallen back to the
[07:02 --> 07:06] defensible western quarter of the island and was using it as a base to
[07:06 --> 07:08] run a guerrilla insurrection against the Roman occupation.
[07:09 --> 07:14] He spent years harassing and confounding the Romans until he was finally drawn
[07:14 --> 07:16] into a set battle in 50 AD.
[07:18 --> 07:21] Though the king set himself up as best he could, taking the high ground and
[07:21 --> 07:25] building a decent string of fortifications, the Romans were able to
[07:25 --> 07:29] penetrate the defenses and once inside the British line, cut through the
[07:29 --> 07:30] locals with ruthless efficiency.
[07:32 --> 07:35] The Romans captured Coraticus's wife and brothers, but the chief
[07:35 --> 07:37] himself managed to slip away.
[07:37 --> 07:41] He fled north and tried to take refuge with a neighboring tribe, but the
[07:41 --> 07:45] Roman allied queen of the territory immediately handed Coraticus over to
[07:45 --> 07:48] the Romans as a show of loyalty to the new foreign overlords.
[07:49 --> 07:52] With that, the most prominent and able leader of the British
[07:52 --> 07:56] resistance was whisked off the island and taken back to Rome, where
[07:56 --> 07:58] he was paraded around as a prized treasure.
[07:59 --> 08:03] But unlike, say, Vercingetorix, who rotted away in a cell for years
[08:03 --> 08:07] until Caesar found the time to have him strangled, Coraticus was dealt
[08:07 --> 08:11] with immediately, and surprisingly, after impressing the Romans with
[08:11 --> 08:15] the utterly unrepentant way that he carried himself, they let him live.
[08:16 --> 08:19] He had requested and received an audience with the Senate, and when
[08:19 --> 08:23] he stood before them, he gave a memorable speech that wound up
[08:23 --> 08:24] saving his life.
[08:24 --> 08:28] He said, I had horses, men, arms, and wealth.
[08:28 --> 08:31] What wonder if I was unwilling to lose them?
[08:32 --> 08:35] If you wish to command everyone, does it really follow that everyone
[08:35 --> 08:36] should accept your slavery?
[08:37 --> 08:40] If I were now being handed over as one who had surrendered
[08:40 --> 08:44] immediately, neither my fortune nor your glory would have achieved
[08:44 --> 08:45] brilliance.
[08:46 --> 08:49] Then he asked them point blank to spare his life so that he
[08:49 --> 08:52] could remain an eternal symbol of Rome's clemency.
[08:53 --> 08:56] Really, it was a savvy bit of work for a man facing almost
[08:56 --> 08:59] certain execution, and the audacity of the whole spectacle impressed
[08:59 --> 09:03] Claudius, and the emperor spared the British king's life, allowing
[09:03 --> 09:05] him to set up a nice little farm in Italy to live out the rest
[09:05 --> 09:06] of his days.
[09:08 --> 09:10] Before he passes from our narrative, I will let Coraticus
[09:10 --> 09:11] have one final word.
[09:12 --> 09:15] Touring Rome, he was impressed with the splendor of the great
[09:15 --> 09:19] capital and remarked, and can you then, who have such possessions
[09:19 --> 09:22] and so many of them, covet our poor tents?
[09:23 --> 09:26] Which I think is a question worth asking.
[09:28 --> 09:32] With his success in policy and in war, Claudius was cementing
[09:32 --> 09:36] a reputation for overseeing a pretty competent administration.
[09:37 --> 09:40] Like I said last week, though, more than a few Romans were
[09:40 --> 09:42] unwilling to believe that Claudius was really calling the
[09:42 --> 09:46] shots, so running parallel and in opposition to this
[09:46 --> 09:49] reputation for running a pretty good ship was a reputation
[09:49 --> 09:52] for having a pretty good ship run him.
[09:53 --> 09:55] And it wasn't just his freedmen who were said to pilot
[09:55 --> 09:56] Claudius around.
[09:57 --> 09:59] It was also his various wives.
[10:01 --> 10:03] Claudius never had the best luck with women.
[10:04 --> 10:07] His obvious physical defects made marrying him quite a bit
[10:07 --> 10:09] more difficult than finding a suitable mate for his brother
[10:09 --> 10:10] or sister.
[10:11 --> 10:13] The first time the imperial family found somebody to say
[10:13 --> 10:16] yes to an engagement, the match was soon after broken
[10:16 --> 10:18] off for political reasons.
[10:19 --> 10:22] His next fiance lasted all the way to the altar, but
[10:22 --> 10:23] then died on their wedding day.
[10:23 --> 10:27] So for Claudius, that would be 0 for 2.
[10:27 --> 10:30] His third marriage attempt finally took and he was paired
[10:30 --> 10:33] with a woman named Pladia Ergo Lanilla, the daughter
[10:33 --> 10:34] of a friend of Livius.
[10:35 --> 10:38] Basically, the Augusta was owed a favor and she cashed
[10:38 --> 10:39] it in.
[10:40 --> 10:42] The union produced Claudius's first child, a son named
[10:42 --> 10:46] Claudius Drusus, who tragically died of asphyxiation
[10:46 --> 10:47] when he was just entering his teens.
[10:48 --> 10:52] The marriage was destined for a similar fate and in 24 AD
[10:52 --> 10:55] Ergo Lanilla was not only accused of adultery, but
[10:55 --> 10:58] also that she had conspired to murder her sister-in-law.
[10:59 --> 11:01] After their divorce was finalized, Ergo Lanilla
[11:01 --> 11:04] gave birth to a second child, a daughter named
[11:04 --> 11:06] Claudia, who Claudius repudiated, as it was
[11:06 --> 11:08] widely known that he was not even the father.
[11:09 --> 11:11] So far, not so good.
[11:13 --> 11:16] A bachelor once more, Claudius was targeted by
[11:16 --> 11:18] Sejanus as the perfect match for the prefect's
[11:18 --> 11:20] adopted sister, Pitina.
[11:21 --> 11:23] Floating like a leaf down the tumultuous river of
[11:23 --> 11:26] Roman politics, Claudius no doubt saw the value
[11:26 --> 11:28] in being related to the ruthlessly ambitious
[11:28 --> 11:30] Sejanus as the prefect's star was rising.
[11:31 --> 11:33] So Claudius allowed himself to be used as a
[11:33 --> 11:36] conduit for Sejanus's entry into the Julio
[11:36 --> 11:39] Claudian family, and he married Pitina in 28 AD.
[11:41 --> 11:43] Once Sejanus fell though, Claudius couldn't
[11:43 --> 11:45] afford any connections to the disgraced prefect
[11:45 --> 11:47] and he divorced his wife.
[11:47 --> 11:50] While those around him drowned, Claudius
[11:50 --> 11:52] continued to float down river.
[11:54 --> 11:55] His next marriage came after Caligula
[11:55 --> 11:57] ascended to the throne.
[11:58 --> 12:00] Whether by luck or design, Claudius paired
[12:00 --> 12:02] up with a regular and influential member of
[12:02 --> 12:05] the young emperor's court, a woman named
[12:05 --> 12:06] Valeria Messalina.
[12:08 --> 12:10] Messalina was an ambitious woman, and while
[12:10 --> 12:12] it sure seems to be the case that nobody
[12:12 --> 12:15] really wanted to marry Claudius, Messalina
[12:15 --> 12:17] was pretty excited to at least be marrying
[12:17 --> 12:18] the uncle of the emperor.
[12:19 --> 12:22] That that uncle was, well, Claudius was no
[12:22 --> 12:23] great problem.
[12:24 --> 12:25] Messalina wasn't planning on being tied
[12:25 --> 12:27] down, if you know what I mean.
[12:28 --> 12:30] The match worked out well for both of them
[12:30 --> 12:31] for a time.
[12:31 --> 12:33] Messalina was married into the imperial
[12:33 --> 12:35] family and Claudius now had an additional
[12:35 --> 12:37] layer of protection to get him through the
[12:37 --> 12:39] crazy years of Caligula's reign.
[12:40 --> 12:42] Messalina fit right in with Caligula's
[12:42 --> 12:44] court and had some influence over the
[12:44 --> 12:47] emperor, so because Messalina needed
[12:47 --> 12:48] Claudius to cement her ties with the
[12:48 --> 12:50] family, she would always be a fierce
[12:50 --> 12:53] advocate within Caligula's inner circle
[12:53 --> 12:55] to not execute Claudius should the whim
[12:55 --> 12:57] to do so crop up, which reportedly it
[12:57 --> 12:59] did on more than one occasion.
[13:01 --> 13:03] Together, if usually apart, Claudius and
[13:03 --> 13:05] Messalina survived the random madness
[13:05 --> 13:07] of Caligula, and after Claudius ascended
[13:07 --> 13:10] to the throne, Messalina suddenly and
[13:10 --> 13:12] surprisingly found herself empress,
[13:12 --> 13:14] which was, I think, an ambition beyond
[13:14 --> 13:15] her wildest dreams.
[13:17 --> 13:19] She bore Claudius two children, a
[13:19 --> 13:21] daughter named Claudia Octavia, who will
[13:21 --> 13:23] eventually marry Nero, and a son called
[13:23 --> 13:25] Britannicus, named in honor of his
[13:25 --> 13:27] father's recent triumph in Britain.
[13:28 --> 13:30] Now, she was not only the wife of the
[13:30 --> 13:32] emperor, but also the mother of the
[13:32 --> 13:33] heir apparent Britannicus.
[13:34 --> 13:36] Not since Livia had Rome seen a woman
[13:36 --> 13:38] in such a powerful position, and
[13:38 --> 13:41] Messalina, like Livia before her, did
[13:41 --> 13:43] not hesitate to use her newfound powers.
[13:45 --> 13:47] No shrinking violet, Messalina jumped
[13:47 --> 13:49] right into politics, and using
[13:49 --> 13:51] Claudius as her instrument, the
[13:51 --> 13:52] empress usually had her way.
[13:54 --> 13:55] Unfortunately, she did not whisper in
[13:55 --> 13:57] the emperor's ear to turn his attention
[13:57 --> 14:00] towards this neglected policy, or make
[14:00 --> 14:02] him an advocate for that necessary
[14:02 --> 14:05] reform. No, not anything so useful as that.
[14:06 --> 14:08] The empress was an insecure woman,
[14:09 --> 14:10] and well aware that Claudius was
[14:10 --> 14:12] old and had a history of physical
[14:12 --> 14:14] problems, if he were to die, she knew
[14:14 --> 14:16] that she would lose everything just as
[14:16 --> 14:17] quickly as she had gained it.
[14:18 --> 14:19] So the first and last order of
[14:19 --> 14:21] business was securing her own
[14:21 --> 14:23] position, and it was toward that end
[14:23 --> 14:25] alone that she whispered in the
[14:25 --> 14:26] emperor's ear.
[14:28 --> 14:30] Luckily, in the political climate of
[14:30 --> 14:32] the times allowed Messalina to
[14:32 --> 14:33] operate, probably with the aid of
[14:33 --> 14:36] Narcissus, a sort of shadow purge
[14:36 --> 14:38] mechanism to deal with men and women
[14:38 --> 14:40] and children she considered a threat
[14:40 --> 14:41] to her personally.
[14:42 --> 14:43] There were so many real plots against
[14:43 --> 14:45] Claudius's life to be dealt with, that
[14:45 --> 14:47] when the emperor's wife and most
[14:47 --> 14:49] trusted advisor brought some new list
[14:49 --> 14:51] of names and assured him that they
[14:51 --> 14:52] had discovered some new conspiracy,
[14:53 --> 14:54] it did not really set off any
[14:54 --> 14:55] warning bells.
[14:56 --> 14:58] Consuls, ex-consuls, influential
[14:58 --> 15:00] women, up and coming senators,
[15:00 --> 15:02] academics, if Messalina thought they
[15:02 --> 15:04] might cause her problems, it was
[15:04 --> 15:06] exile or execution.
[15:06 --> 15:08] Claudius did not ask too many
[15:08 --> 15:09] questions.
[15:11 --> 15:13] But it was not just Messalina's
[15:13 --> 15:15] concern about Claudius's health that
[15:15 --> 15:17] drove her, it was also the fact that
[15:17 --> 15:19] she daily flirted with disaster by
[15:19 --> 15:21] making a persistent cuckold of her
[15:21 --> 15:21] husband.
[15:23 --> 15:25] The ancient historians are unanimous
[15:25 --> 15:27] in their judgment of the empress.
[15:28 --> 15:29] She was a vain, cruel
[15:29 --> 15:31] nymphomaniac who disgraced Rome and
[15:31 --> 15:33] brought nothing but shame upon herself
[15:33 --> 15:34] and her husband.
[15:36 --> 15:38] Messalina cheated early and often on
[15:38 --> 15:39] Claudius, with men and women
[15:39 --> 15:40] born both high and low.
[15:41 --> 15:42] Her activities were widely
[15:42 --> 15:44] documented and well known, but it
[15:44 --> 15:46] seems that no one had the heart or
[15:46 --> 15:47] the courage to tell Claudius what
[15:47 --> 15:49] was going on, so he remained the
[15:49 --> 15:51] one man in the empire who didn't
[15:51 --> 15:52] know what his wife was up to.
[15:54 --> 15:56] In addition to her regular liaisons
[15:56 --> 15:58] with senators and actors, poets,
[15:58 --> 16:00] slaves and soldiers, there is a
[16:00 --> 16:02] famous story of her competition with
[16:02 --> 16:04] a well-known prostitute to see
[16:04 --> 16:05] which of them could sleep with the
[16:05 --> 16:07] most men in a single day.
[16:08 --> 16:09] Messalina won.
[16:11 --> 16:12] So the empress needed to make sure
[16:12 --> 16:14] her power had a base independent
[16:14 --> 16:16] of Claudius, because who knows
[16:16 --> 16:17] when her dalliances are going to
[16:17 --> 16:19] finally catch up with her and
[16:19 --> 16:20] trigger a divorce.
[16:21 --> 16:23] Eventually, Messalina got
[16:23 --> 16:25] careless or grew emboldened, if
[16:25 --> 16:26] there is a difference between the
[16:26 --> 16:29] two, and began to move away from
[16:29 --> 16:30] simply running around behind
[16:30 --> 16:31] Claudius' back.
[16:32 --> 16:33] Her marriage was obviously a
[16:33 --> 16:35] sham, and she knew that
[16:35 --> 16:36] eventually Claudius would find
[16:36 --> 16:38] out, and that would be the end of her.
[16:39 --> 16:40] Plus, Germanicus' daughter
[16:40 --> 16:42] Agrippina the Younger had been
[16:42 --> 16:43] recalled from exile with her son
[16:43 --> 16:45] Lucius Domitius Ahenabarbis,
[16:46 --> 16:47] the future emperor Nero.
[16:48 --> 16:50] The people had always had a soft
[16:50 --> 16:51] spot in their hearts for
[16:51 --> 16:53] Germanicus' family, and when she
[16:53 --> 16:54] arrived, Agrippina was greeted
[16:54 --> 16:55] warmly by the people.
[16:56 --> 16:59] At the secular games held in 47 AD
[16:59 --> 17:01] to celebrate the 800th anniversary
[17:01 --> 17:02] of the founding of Rome,
[17:03 --> 17:05] Agrippina and her son received
[17:05 --> 17:07] much more applause than Messalina
[17:07 --> 17:07] and her son.
[17:09 --> 17:10] The implication was clear.
[17:11 --> 17:12] Agrippina and Lucius were full
[17:12 --> 17:14] Julians, descended directly from
[17:14 --> 17:15] the divine Augustus.
[17:16 --> 17:18] Messalina, meanwhile, had no
[17:18 --> 17:19] blood ties to the clan, and
[17:19 --> 17:21] her son was merely a Claudian.
[17:22 --> 17:24] Agrippina, as ambitious a woman
[17:24 --> 17:26] as Rome had ever known, was
[17:26 --> 17:27] clearly laying the groundwork
[17:27 --> 17:28] for her son, the grandson of
[17:28 --> 17:30] Germanicus, to ascend to the
[17:30 --> 17:32] throne when Claudius was gone.
[17:33 --> 17:35] With a ready alternative
[17:35 --> 17:37] heir, perhaps even a more
[17:37 --> 17:38] desirable heir standing by,
[17:39 --> 17:40] Messalina could feel her
[17:40 --> 17:41] leverage slipping.
[17:42 --> 17:43] She was no longer as
[17:43 --> 17:44] indispensable as she had once
[17:44 --> 17:45] thought herself.
[17:46 --> 17:47] Her solution to this problem
[17:47 --> 17:49] was not to reform her ways and
[17:49 --> 17:50] devote herself to Claudius and
[17:50 --> 17:52] make sure that Britannicus was
[17:52 --> 17:53] always the first and last
[17:53 --> 17:54] name on the list of heirs.
[17:55 --> 17:57] But instead, she schemed to
[17:57 --> 17:58] get rid of Claudius altogether
[17:58 --> 18:00] before he had a chance to
[18:00 --> 18:01] turn on her.
[18:02 --> 18:04] She had powerful friends, and
[18:04 --> 18:04] more than enough of them
[18:04 --> 18:06] wanted the Julio Claudians
[18:06 --> 18:07] expelled from power, but she
[18:07 --> 18:09] decided to ditch the stuttering
[18:09 --> 18:10] emperor and, with senatorial
[18:10 --> 18:12] support, find a new husband
[18:12 --> 18:13] and elevate him to the
[18:13 --> 18:14] throne.
[18:15 --> 18:16] The Julio Claudians would be
[18:16 --> 18:16] out.
[18:18 --> 18:19] How exactly she thought this
[18:19 --> 18:20] was going to work is sort of
[18:20 --> 18:22] an open question, as in
[18:22 --> 18:24] hindsight, the whole plot
[18:24 --> 18:25] looks not even half-baked,
[18:26 --> 18:27] but more like the mix is
[18:27 --> 18:28] still sitting in a bowl on
[18:28 --> 18:29] the counter.
[18:31 --> 18:32] Messalina had hooked up with
[18:32 --> 18:34] a consul designate named
[18:34 --> 18:36] Gaius Silius, an attractive,
[18:36 --> 18:38] intelligent, and well-bred man
[18:38 --> 18:39] who Messalina hoped would
[18:39 --> 18:40] make a fine emperor.
[18:41 --> 18:43] They carried on an affair
[18:43 --> 18:44] behind the backs of both of
[18:44 --> 18:45] their spouses until Messalina
[18:45 --> 18:47] demanded, in some sort of
[18:47 --> 18:48] test of love and loyalty,
[18:49 --> 18:50] that Silius divorce his wife.
[18:51 --> 18:53] The senator complied and then
[18:53 --> 18:54] began to exert pressure on
[18:54 --> 18:56] Messalina to do the same.
[18:57 --> 18:58] They were both way beyond
[18:58 --> 18:59] the point of no return.
[18:59 --> 19:00] Everyone knew that they were
[19:00 --> 19:02] lovers and why Silius had
[19:02 --> 19:03] divorced his wife, so they
[19:03 --> 19:05] may as well go all in.
[19:06 --> 19:07] Finally, Messalina agreed
[19:07 --> 19:08] that it was time for them
[19:08 --> 19:09] to make their move.
[19:10 --> 19:11] They would wed first and
[19:11 --> 19:13] then kill Claudius.
[19:13 --> 19:14] Silius, the husband of
[19:14 --> 19:15] the empress, would step
[19:15 --> 19:17] into power and everything
[19:17 --> 19:18] would be super-duper.
[19:19 --> 19:20] Except, what?
[19:21 --> 19:22] Did they really think that
[19:22 --> 19:23] they would be able to get
[19:23 --> 19:24] married without the emperor
[19:24 --> 19:26] finding out about it, and
[19:26 --> 19:27] that once he found out
[19:27 --> 19:28] that his wife had, you
[19:28 --> 19:30] know, openly left him for
[19:30 --> 19:31] another man, that her
[19:31 --> 19:32] position of empress would
[19:32 --> 19:33] not be compromised?
[19:34 --> 19:35] The whole episode is
[19:35 --> 19:37] just weirdly unthought out.
[19:39 --> 19:40] Regardless, in 48, when
[19:40 --> 19:42] Claudius was in Ostia
[19:42 --> 19:43] overseeing a construction
[19:43 --> 19:44] project, Messalina and
[19:44 --> 19:45] Silius got married.
[19:46 --> 19:47] And not some secret
[19:47 --> 19:48] wedding where the
[19:48 --> 19:49] witnesses are sworn not
[19:49 --> 19:50] to reveal what they have
[19:50 --> 19:51] seen and the priest is
[19:51 --> 19:52] killed afterwards.
[19:53 --> 19:54] No, a big, lavish
[19:54 --> 19:55] ceremony.
[19:55 --> 19:57] Drinks, dancing, the
[19:57 --> 19:59] works, all right out in
[19:59 --> 19:59] the open.
[20:00 --> 20:02] Narcissus finally decided
[20:02 --> 20:03] at this point that things
[20:03 --> 20:04] had gone far enough.
[20:04 --> 20:06] Well, way too far, actually,
[20:06 --> 20:08] and resolved now to tell
[20:08 --> 20:09] the truth to Claudius about
[20:09 --> 20:10] his wife.
[20:11 --> 20:12] Though Narcissus had
[20:12 --> 20:13] formed a convenient
[20:13 --> 20:14] alliance with Messalina,
[20:14 --> 20:16] his first loyalty was to
[20:16 --> 20:17] Claudius, and it was
[20:17 --> 20:18] pretty clear that a major
[20:18 --> 20:19] coup was in the works.
[20:20 --> 20:21] It was time to throw
[20:21 --> 20:22] Messalina under the bus.
[20:24 --> 20:25] Narcissus induced two of
[20:25 --> 20:26] Claudius' mistresses,
[20:26 --> 20:27] yes, Claudius had
[20:27 --> 20:29] mistresses, which was
[20:29 --> 20:31] different, to reveal the
[20:31 --> 20:33] truth about Messalina's
[20:33 --> 20:33] infidelity.
[20:34 --> 20:35] Once the code of silence
[20:35 --> 20:37] was broken, everyone that
[20:37 --> 20:38] Claudius turned to for
[20:38 --> 20:39] confirmation confirmed
[20:39 --> 20:40] the stories.
[20:41 --> 20:42] The emperor headed back
[20:42 --> 20:44] to Rome, but before he
[20:44 --> 20:45] arrived, Messalina got
[20:45 --> 20:46] word that the jig was
[20:46 --> 20:47] up and that her husband
[20:47 --> 20:48] now knew everything.
[20:49 --> 20:50] She packed up the
[20:50 --> 20:51] children and headed out
[20:51 --> 20:52] on the road to Ostia to
[20:52 --> 20:54] intercept Claudius and
[20:54 --> 20:55] hopefully talk to him
[20:55 --> 20:56] alone before he turned on
[20:56 --> 20:57] her completely.
[20:57 --> 20:59] But as she approached the
[20:59 --> 21:00] imperial procession,
[21:00 --> 21:01] Narcissus, riding with
[21:01 --> 21:03] Claudius, openly denounced
[21:03 --> 21:04] her and forbade her from
[21:04 --> 21:05] speaking with Claudius
[21:05 --> 21:06] privately.
[21:07 --> 21:08] Messalina tagged along as
[21:08 --> 21:09] the entourage made its
[21:09 --> 21:11] way back to Rome, but
[21:11 --> 21:12] was never able to crack
[21:12 --> 21:13] the perimeter Narcissus
[21:13 --> 21:14] had set up around the
[21:14 --> 21:15] emperor's carriage.
[21:16 --> 21:17] Back in the city,
[21:17 --> 21:18] Claudius was taken
[21:18 --> 21:19] straight away to the
[21:19 --> 21:20] home of Silius, which
[21:20 --> 21:22] Narcissus told him he
[21:22 --> 21:23] would practically be able
[21:23 --> 21:24] to recognize as his own.
[21:25 --> 21:26] Messalina had been
[21:26 --> 21:27] transferring imperial
[21:27 --> 21:28] furniture and art into the
[21:28 --> 21:29] home of her lover for
[21:29 --> 21:31] some time, and as soon as
[21:31 --> 21:32] he walked in, Claudius
[21:32 --> 21:33] knew that all the
[21:33 --> 21:34] accusations were true.
[21:36 --> 21:37] Messalina tried to deny
[21:37 --> 21:38] everything, especially
[21:38 --> 21:39] the crazy notion that
[21:39 --> 21:40] she had openly married
[21:40 --> 21:41] Silius.
[21:41 --> 21:42] I mean, how stupid
[21:42 --> 21:43] would that be?
[21:43 --> 21:44] But the literally
[21:44 --> 21:45] hundreds of witnesses
[21:45 --> 21:47] to the ceremony were
[21:47 --> 21:48] hard to argue with.
[21:49 --> 21:50] Even still, Claudius,
[21:50 --> 21:51] who was naturally
[21:51 --> 21:52] inclined towards
[21:52 --> 21:53] forgiveness, wavered
[21:53 --> 21:54] over the fate of his wife.
[21:55 --> 21:56] Narcissus, Pallas,
[21:57 --> 21:57] and the other
[21:57 --> 21:58] influential freedmen,
[21:59 --> 21:59] were adamant that she
[21:59 --> 22:00] must be executed,
[22:01 --> 22:01] and that what she had
[22:01 --> 22:03] done was nothing less
[22:03 --> 22:04] than treason.
[22:04 --> 22:05] But Claudius hesitated.
[22:06 --> 22:07] The story then goes
[22:07 --> 22:08] that Narcissus used
[22:08 --> 22:09] the emperor's seal
[22:09 --> 22:10] to send the execution
[22:10 --> 22:11] order himself.
[22:12 --> 22:13] A soldier knocked down
[22:13 --> 22:14] Messalina's door
[22:14 --> 22:15] and presented her
[22:15 --> 22:15] with the warrant,
[22:16 --> 22:17] giving her the option
[22:17 --> 22:18] of committing suicide
[22:18 --> 22:18] if she chose.
[22:19 --> 22:20] But when she could not
[22:20 --> 22:22] bring herself to do it,
[22:22 --> 22:23] the guard stabbed her
[22:23 --> 22:24] to death.
[22:25 --> 22:26] Claudius was informed
[22:26 --> 22:27] after the fact
[22:27 --> 22:28] and is reported to
[22:28 --> 22:28] have taken the news
[22:28 --> 22:29] without showing much
[22:29 --> 22:30] sign one way or the
[22:30 --> 22:31] other that he cared,
[22:31 --> 22:32] which seems a bit
[22:32 --> 22:33] out of character,
[22:33 --> 22:34] as he seemed
[22:34 --> 22:35] genuinely devoted to her,
[22:35 --> 22:37] but that's what they say.
[22:38 --> 22:40] Tacitus closes his chapter
[22:40 --> 22:41] on the fall of Messalina
[22:41 --> 22:41] with a line,
[22:42 --> 22:43] the vengeance on Messalina
[22:43 --> 22:44] was just,
[22:44 --> 22:45] but it had terrible
[22:45 --> 22:46] consequences.
[22:48 --> 22:49] There will be no episode
[22:49 --> 22:49] next week,
[22:50 --> 22:50] but when we return
[22:50 --> 22:51] in two weeks,
[22:51 --> 22:52] we will get into
[22:52 --> 22:53] those terrible consequences.
[22:54 --> 22:55] The emperor couldn't
[22:55 --> 22:56] remain a bachelor for long,
[22:57 --> 22:57] and in the search
[22:57 --> 22:58] for a new empress,
[22:58 --> 23:00] each of his freedmen
[23:00 --> 23:01] backed a different candidate.
[23:03 --> 23:04] Narcissus advised
[23:04 --> 23:05] remarrying Pitina.
[23:05 --> 23:06] Her daughter with
[23:06 --> 23:06] Claudius,
[23:07 --> 23:08] Claudia Antonia,
[23:08 --> 23:09] had married a fine young man
[23:09 --> 23:11] named Faustus Cornelius
[23:11 --> 23:11] Sulla Felix,
[23:12 --> 23:13] a descendant of
[23:13 --> 23:13] the original Sulla,
[23:14 --> 23:15] who was also a cousin
[23:15 --> 23:16] of the central
[23:16 --> 23:17] Julio-Claudian dynasty.
[23:18 --> 23:19] Narcissus had begun
[23:19 --> 23:20] to have his doubts
[23:20 --> 23:20] about the worth
[23:20 --> 23:22] of Britannicus as an heir
[23:22 --> 23:23] and hoped that the older
[23:23 --> 23:25] and more experienced Faustus
[23:25 --> 23:27] would win the emperor's favor.
[23:28 --> 23:29] Callistus, on the other hand,
[23:29 --> 23:30] advised marrying
[23:30 --> 23:31] Lolia Paulina,
[23:31 --> 23:33] an ex-wife of Caligula,
[23:33 --> 23:34] who he knew from the time
[23:34 --> 23:35] they had spent together
[23:35 --> 23:36] in the previous emperor's court.
[23:38 --> 23:38] You can see that
[23:38 --> 23:39] each of the freedmen
[23:39 --> 23:41] was backing a different horse,
[23:41 --> 23:42] not just because they thought
[23:42 --> 23:44] that their preferred candidate
[23:44 --> 23:45] would be better for Claudius,
[23:45 --> 23:47] but also because they thought
[23:47 --> 23:47] that she would be better
[23:47 --> 23:49] for them personally.
[23:50 --> 23:51] The secretary of the
[23:51 --> 23:52] treasury palace, though,
[23:52 --> 23:54] would eventually win the argument.
[23:54 --> 23:56] He pushed for a union
[23:56 --> 23:57] with Agrippina.
[23:58 --> 23:59] The Julians and Claudians
[23:59 --> 24:00] had been split from the time
[24:00 --> 24:01] of the rivalry between
[24:01 --> 24:03] Tiberius and Germanicus,
[24:03 --> 24:05] and it was time to heal the rift.
[24:06 --> 24:07] Plus Agrippina and her son
[24:07 --> 24:09] would always be a
[24:09 --> 24:10] rallying point for dissidents
[24:10 --> 24:11] as long as they remained
[24:11 --> 24:12] outside the dynasty.
[24:13 --> 24:15] Co-op them and a major threat
[24:15 --> 24:16] to Claudius would be
[24:16 --> 24:17] instantly eliminated.
[24:18 --> 24:19] Claudius was moved
[24:19 --> 24:20] by these last points
[24:20 --> 24:22] and decided to marry Agrippina
[24:22 --> 24:24] on New Year's Day of 48 A.D.
[24:25 --> 24:26] Now, this decision
[24:26 --> 24:27] was not without controversy.
[24:28 --> 24:29] We have covered a few marriages
[24:29 --> 24:31] so far that would be considered
[24:31 --> 24:33] incestual by our standards,
[24:33 --> 24:34] but did not raise an eyebrow
[24:34 --> 24:35] in ancient Rome.
[24:36 --> 24:38] But a man marrying the daughter
[24:38 --> 24:39] of his brother?
[24:39 --> 24:41] That, my friends, is incest.
[24:42 --> 24:43] The people were shocked,
[24:44 --> 24:45] scandalized by the news,
[24:45 --> 24:46] and they hated it,
[24:46 --> 24:47] hated it, hated it.
[24:48 --> 24:50] But it was not the scandalous
[24:50 --> 24:51] nature of the marriage
[24:51 --> 24:53] that was the terrible consequence
[24:53 --> 24:54] that Tacitus referred to.
[24:55 --> 24:56] Rather, it was what happened
[24:56 --> 24:58] once Agrippina got into power.
[24:59 --> 25:01] Like Livia before her,
[25:01 --> 25:02] she strove with a single-minded
[25:02 --> 25:04] purpose to place her own son
[25:04 --> 25:05] on the throne.
[25:05 --> 25:07] And there is no arguing
[25:07 --> 25:09] that Nero becoming emperor

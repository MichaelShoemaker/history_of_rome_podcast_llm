[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 25, The Syrian War.
[00:12 --> 00:17] Last week, Rome was drawn into the thick of Greek politics and emerged from its brief
[00:17 --> 00:21] war with Philip of Macedon, the leading power west of the Aegean.
[00:22 --> 00:27] The hero of the Second Macedonian War, Gaius Flaminius, had declared Greece free
[00:27 --> 00:30] from foreign interference, to the great joy of the proud Greeks.
[00:32 --> 00:36] However, it was a peculiar form of freedom, as Flaminius did not seem to count Rome
[00:36 --> 00:39] amongst the foreign powers Greece was free from.
[00:40 --> 00:44] Soon enough, the Greeks would begin to look sideways at their liberators, who were
[00:44 --> 00:46] fast becoming occupiers.
[00:47 --> 00:51] A faction of Greeks, fed up with the Roman presence, would look across the Aegean
[00:51 --> 00:56] to the only other power in the Mediterranean who could possibly expel the Romans, the
[00:56 --> 01:00] Seleucid Empire of Syria, led by Antiochus the Great.
[01:02 --> 01:07] Trouble began in 195 BC, the year after Flaminius' declaration.
[01:08 --> 01:12] The Aetolian League, the collection of cities that had been Rome's first allies
[01:12 --> 01:16] in Greece, felt they had not received the rewards they deserved for all the help
[01:16 --> 01:17] they had given the Romans.
[01:18 --> 01:22] All their aid for Rome had been given with the assumption that once they helped
[01:22 --> 01:27] clear out Macedon, the Aetolian League would be handed control of Greece, with
[01:27 --> 01:29] Rome withdrawing into the role of silent partner.
[01:30 --> 01:33] But the generous Romans had not punished their Greek enemies at the bargaining
[01:33 --> 01:38] table, and had left the existing power structure in place, granting the
[01:38 --> 01:42] Aetolians no more control than they had prior to the war against Philip.
[01:43 --> 01:47] Rome was well aware of the Aetolian grievances, and was also well aware
[01:47 --> 01:51] that the Aetolians were entering negotiations with Sparta to form an
[01:51 --> 01:55] alliance that could then offer itself to Antiochus if the Syrian king agreed to
[01:55 --> 01:57] launch an anti-Roman offensive.
[01:58 --> 02:03] Hoping to preempt an alliance, Flaminius led a force against Sparta, and easily
[02:03 --> 02:04] overran the outnumbered Greeks.
[02:05 --> 02:09] The move was a tactical victory in the sense that it forestalled an
[02:09 --> 02:14] Aetolian-Spartan alliance, but strategically the move backfired, turning Greek public
[02:14 --> 02:15] opinion against Rome.
[02:16 --> 02:20] If Greece was free, why was a Roman army attacking Sparta?
[02:20 --> 02:24] If Greece was free, what was a Roman army doing here in the first place?
[02:25 --> 02:28] The public relations crisis only ballooned from there.
[02:28 --> 02:32] Friends of Rome and Greece were fast becoming an endangered species.
[02:35 --> 02:39] At the same time Rome moved against Sparta, envoys, including the leading
[02:39 --> 02:44] citizen of his day, Scipio Africanus, were sent to Antiochus in Syria to
[02:44 --> 02:45] convince him to keep out of Greece.
[02:46 --> 02:50] The Roman delegates announced their policy of Greek freedom and ordered
[02:50 --> 02:53] Antiochus to stay on his side of the Hellespont.
[02:54 --> 02:58] Antiochus was amused by these demands, pointing out that if Greece was so
[02:58 --> 02:59] free, what were the Romans doing there?
[03:00 --> 03:04] It was a fair point, and the Romans had no real answer for it.
[03:04 --> 03:08] Antiochus sent the delegation away, telling them flatly that Roman demands
[03:08 --> 03:12] regarding Greece were as absurd as Antiochus dictating policy to the
[03:12 --> 03:13] Romans in Italy.
[03:14 --> 03:17] They would each do well to mind their own business.
[03:19 --> 03:24] But before the cordial visit passed into open antagonism, Antiochus greeted
[03:24 --> 03:26] the Romans with all the honors due of visiting power.
[03:27 --> 03:32] Present also as a guest of Antiochus was Hannibal, the scourge of
[03:32 --> 03:34] Carthage now living with the king in exile.
[03:35 --> 03:38] In one of the most interesting face-to-face meetings of the ancient
[03:38 --> 03:42] world, Scipio and Hannibal found themselves present at a banquet
[03:42 --> 03:43] together.
[03:44 --> 03:48] Scipio, perhaps needling Hannibal a bit, asked the Carthaginian
[03:48 --> 03:51] casually who he thought were the greatest generals in history.
[03:52 --> 03:55] Hannibal replied that he placed Alexander first, a choice
[03:55 --> 03:57] Scipio heartily seconded.
[03:58 --> 04:02] Next, Hannibal, needling the Romans back a bit, announced that
[04:02 --> 04:05] Pyrrhus was his choice for second greatest general of all time,
[04:06 --> 04:09] pointing out his succession of victories against the Romans.
[04:10 --> 04:14] Hannibal then boldly declared that he put himself third on the list.
[04:14 --> 04:17] Scipio, who was preparing for the satisfaction of Hannibal
[04:17 --> 04:21] acknowledging that he was the better general, was shocked at the choice.
[04:21 --> 04:25] How could Hannibal claim he was better than a man who had beaten him?
[04:26 --> 04:29] As a way of reminding Hannibal of the outcome at Zama, he asked
[04:29 --> 04:33] Hannibal, and where would you stand if you had actually, you know, beaten me?
[04:34 --> 04:37] Hannibal replied that had he beaten Scipio, he would place
[04:37 --> 04:42] himself even above Alexander, a backhanded acknowledgement that
[04:42 --> 04:45] beating Scipio would have indeed been a major accomplishment, but that
[04:45 --> 04:49] the Roman general did not merit a place amongst the very best of all time.
[04:50 --> 04:54] Scipio nursed his wounded ego, no doubt, by remembering that he was
[04:54 --> 04:58] dining with the king of Syria as a leading representative of a great power,
[04:58 --> 05:01] while Hannibal was dining as little more than a beggar.
[05:02 --> 05:03] Who's the best general now, sucker?
[05:05 --> 05:10] At the conclusion of the meeting between Syria and Rome, the two powers were at loggerheads.
[05:11 --> 05:15] Both sides were being goaded by their allies in Greece to fight it out.
[05:15 --> 05:18] The Aetolians were begging Antiochus to drive the Romans out of Greece,
[05:19 --> 05:24] and the Kingdom of Pergamum was egging Rome into attacking its neighbor Antiochus.
[05:24 --> 05:28] Hannibal told the Syrian king he would gladly lead an invasion of Italy himself
[05:28 --> 05:30] if given the troops and supplies.
[05:31 --> 05:36] But no direct confrontation was forthcoming, so the Aetolians decided to press the issue
[05:36 --> 05:41] by launching simultaneous attacks on three Roman-allied Greek cities,
[05:41 --> 05:45] each of which would serve as a safe point of entry for any Syrian army.
[05:46 --> 05:50] They were repulsed in two of the cities, but welcomed by the citizens of Demetrius,
[05:51 --> 05:52] who were fed up with the Roman presence.
[05:55 --> 05:59] This action, coupled with the fact that the Romans were showing signs of stepping back from
[05:59 --> 06:03] Greece, convinced Antiochus that the time was ripe for an invasion.
[06:04 --> 06:07] He gathered 10,000 troops and sailed for Demetrius.
[06:08 --> 06:11] When he arrived, however, two facts became immediately apparent.
[06:12 --> 06:15] First, the Aetolians had painted a somewhat misleading picture
[06:15 --> 06:17] of the reception Antiochus would receive.
[06:18 --> 06:23] Greeted not as a welcome liberator, Antiochus was treated as just another foreign invader
[06:23 --> 06:26] and found the gates of Greece closed to his army.
[06:27 --> 06:33] Second, Roman interest in Greece was waning only as long as no other power stepped into the vacuum.
[06:34 --> 06:38] The arrival of the Syrians triggered an immediate Roman response.
[06:38 --> 06:42] Two legions were mustered and sailed for a pyrus where they landed
[06:42 --> 06:46] and began a march straight for the invaders, who were camped on the Aegean coast.
[06:47 --> 06:51] At the same time, the Achaean League, a rival confederation of the Aetolians,
[06:52 --> 06:54] declared for Rome and joined the legions.
[06:55 --> 07:00] Antiochus and his 10,000 were facing an army that had grown to more than double that size.
[07:02 --> 07:05] Knowing he had miscalculated but unwilling to simply run for it,
[07:06 --> 07:11] Antiochus looked around for a nearby spot where the clear numerical superiority of the
[07:11 --> 07:16] Romans would be negated and settled on the most famous bottleneck in history, Thermopylae.
[07:17 --> 07:21] 300 Spartans had stood against 2 million Persians, right?
[07:21 --> 07:24] 10,000 versus 20,000 would be a pretty safe bet.
[07:26 --> 07:29] Except that the Syrians were not the Spartans, the Romans were not the Persians,
[07:30 --> 07:34] and everyone and their mother knew by now that there were ways of getting around the narrow pass.
[07:36 --> 07:39] It may have looked good on paper, or I guess I should say papyrus,
[07:39 --> 07:44] but when the Romans arrived, this battle of Thermopylae had none of the luster of the
[07:44 --> 07:50] original. Roman victory was quick and decisive. Antiochus fled back across the Hellespont
[07:50 --> 07:54] and the Romans, smelling blood, came fast on his heels.
[07:56 --> 08:00] The one lasting legacy of this battle of Thermopylae was the entrance of Cato the
[08:00 --> 08:06] Elder onto history's stage. The man who would dominate Roman politics for the next 50 years
[08:06 --> 08:11] made a name for himself leading the charge around the rear of the Syrian army that proved
[08:11 --> 08:17] to be the critical maneuver of the battle. Cato, the great conservative of his time,
[08:17 --> 08:22] would be the leading defender of old Roman virtue and find himself constantly at odds with
[08:22 --> 08:28] Scipio Africanus, who represented the modern Roman man, Hellenized and worldly. Cato fought
[08:28 --> 08:33] a losing battle against the evolution of the Roman character, but was idolized by future
[08:33 --> 08:39] generations who longed for the simple Stoicism of a now largely mythical Golden Age they held
[08:39 --> 08:43] out in contrast to the modern corrupt state they lived with.
[08:45 --> 08:52] In 190 BC, adopting a clearly aggressive stance toward Antiochus, the Romans elected his
[08:52 --> 08:57] consul, Neus Scipio, the brother of Scipio Africanus, and sent the two brothers to Greece
[08:57 --> 09:04] to pursue what policies they would. The Scipiones, notoriously bold, did not waste
[09:04 --> 09:08] time and took their armies across the Hellespont, leading the Romans into Asia
[09:09 --> 09:16] time. As this was occurring, in the south, Hannibal, who had for reasons of court jealousy
[09:16 --> 09:22] been left out of Antiochus's general staff, was relegated to commanding a small fleet of ships
[09:22 --> 09:28] engaged with the Roman ally Rhodes off the coast of Asia Minor. The great commander,
[09:28 --> 09:33] whose talents were clearly wasted, was unable to pry victory from the jaws of defeat
[09:33 --> 09:39] and found himself routed by the Rhodesian navy. Who knows what would have happened if Antiochus
[09:39 --> 09:43] had allowed Hannibal to lead his forces into Greece or placed him at the head of the army
[09:43 --> 09:48] that was about to be annihilated by the Scipione brothers. Maybe Roman inertia would
[09:48 --> 09:53] have proved too much to overcome, but then again maybe the Carthaginian general could
[09:53 --> 09:58] have played a role in keeping the Romans bottled up in the west. Certainly, leaving
[09:58 --> 10:02] Hannibal on the bench was not a move that served Antiochus well.
[10:03 --> 10:08] The decisive battle came at Magnesia, on the border between Pergamum and Syria,
[10:08 --> 10:13] in modern-day Turkey, where Antiochus had gathered 70,000 Syrian and mercenary troops.
[10:14 --> 10:20] Against this force marched 50,000 Italians and a mixture of Greek allies. The numerical
[10:20 --> 10:25] superiority of the Syrians was easily offset by the far greater talent of the Romans.
[10:26 --> 10:30] The undertrained Syrians lacked the hard-nosed professionalism of the Romans,
[10:30 --> 10:35] and the outcome of the battle was never in doubt. Antiochus's army was crushed,
[10:35 --> 10:40] and the disparity between the two supposedly equal powers was thrown out into the open.
[10:41 --> 10:46] With a victorious and practically unscathed Roman army standing triumphant deep in Asia
[10:46 --> 10:51] Minor, the truth became apparent. Rome had no equal in the Mediterranean.
[10:52 --> 10:58] The terms Rome laid at the feet of Antiochus were harsh. A huge cash payment was demanded,
[10:59 --> 11:03] hostages of the ruling families were taken back to Rome, and the Syrian king agreed to
[11:03 --> 11:08] never again cross the Taurus Mountains, which stood between Anatolia and the mainland Middle
[11:08 --> 11:14] East. This range became the de facto frontier of the rapidly expanding Roman Empire.
[11:15 --> 11:20] Though Greece and Asia Minor would not be incorporated as official provinces for years,
[11:20 --> 11:26] Roman rule in the region was never again in doubt. It was a Roman world, the Greeks just lived in it.
[11:29 --> 11:32] The outcome of the war seems like it should have been another feather in the cap of Scipio,
[11:33 --> 11:37] but instead it became the source of a great bitterness that would fill the Roman general
[11:37 --> 11:43] for the rest of his life. Upon returning to Rome, the Scipione brothers were accused by
[11:43 --> 11:48] Cato and his allies of misappropriating war funds. While not denying the charges,
[11:48 --> 11:54] Scipio asked if anyone present was dissatisfied with the fact that Rome was making back five
[11:54 --> 11:58] times what it had put into the war because of the indemnity forced on Antiochus by the two
[11:58 --> 12:06] brothers. Anyone? Anyone? The brothers were off the hook for a while, but charges were
[12:06 --> 12:10] raised again five years later. In a bit of poor planning by the opposition, however,
[12:11 --> 12:14] the charges against Scipio were brought on the anniversary of the Battle of Zama,
[12:14 --> 12:20] and public support for Scipio was at an all-time high. He was never convicted of anything,
[12:21 --> 12:26] but the affair left a bad taste in the general's mouth. Retiring to an estate in Campania,
[12:27 --> 12:32] he died in 183 BC. The epitaph of his tomb allegedly read,
[12:32 --> 12:39] ungrateful fatherland, you will not even have my bones. He never did deny the charges, though.
[12:41 --> 12:48] Next week, Rome will face Deja vu all over again. After the deaths of Philip V and Antiochus
[12:48 --> 12:53] the Great, their sons would pick up the mantle and challenge Rome in the field.
[12:54 --> 12:58] Having not yet felt the sting of defeat, the brash young kings would soon enough find
[12:58 --> 13:03] themselves as beaten and demoralized as their fathers. Fighting Rome was nothing
[13:03 --> 13:05] if not a death blow to the ego.

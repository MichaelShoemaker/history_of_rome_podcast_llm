[00:00 --> 00:15] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 126, All the King's Men.
[00:15 --> 00:20] As you know, when Diocletian came to power in 284, he inherited an empire that had spent
[00:20 --> 00:25] the better part of 50 years getting kicked around the neighborhood.
[00:25 --> 00:29] Everywhere he looked, things were in shambles.
[00:29 --> 00:33] He wanted to revive and restore the empire he had been taught to revere, and as he took
[00:33 --> 00:39] over he faced no greater roadblock to this goal than the problem of the malfunctioning
[00:39 --> 00:43] governmental apparatus he now headed.
[00:43 --> 00:48] What had happened was that as the military crisis became worse and worse, the government
[00:48 --> 00:53] had basically become nothing more than the supply arm of the army.
[00:53 --> 00:57] If civilians entered into the government's calculations at all, it was only to determine
[00:58 --> 01:02] what they might have that the army might need.
[01:02 --> 01:09] Everything else, by the dire necessities of the times, was considered an unimportant distraction.
[01:09 --> 01:15] But now that the crisis had subsided, it became clear what sorts of really important things
[01:15 --> 01:18] had been deemed unimportant distractions.
[01:18 --> 01:22] For example, a functioning judicial system.
[01:22 --> 01:27] Basically, everything that you would expect a government to do, the imperial government
[01:27 --> 01:29] had ceased to do.
[01:29 --> 01:33] It was time then to reinvent that government.
[01:33 --> 01:37] As we've seen, this reinvention started at the very top with the establishment of co-emperors
[01:37 --> 01:42] and then the Tetrarchy, but it would descend all the way down to the local list of local
[01:42 --> 01:47] levels as Diocletian ensured that wherever there were Romans, the Roman government would
[01:47 --> 01:51] be there.
[01:51 --> 01:56] The big problem really was that too much was getting missed.
[01:56 --> 02:00] There are multiple reasons for the fracturing of imperial authority, and the military and
[02:00 --> 02:06] political rationales cannot be understated, but on an administrative level, the establishment
[02:06 --> 02:13] of the Tetrarchy was an extension of Diocletian's desire to get more people focused on fewer
[02:13 --> 02:19] things so that all that stuff that was getting missed would stop getting missed.
[02:19 --> 02:23] Had he done nothing else, the simple fact that there were now four emperors spread out
[02:23 --> 02:29] across the empire instead of just one meant that already four times as much work was getting
[02:29 --> 02:30] done.
[02:30 --> 02:35] Four times as many letters were being answered, four times as many petitions were being ruled
[02:35 --> 02:39] on, four times as many decisions were being made.
[02:39 --> 02:43] And as a bonus, each Tetrarch didn't have to worry about what was going on on the other
[02:43 --> 02:49] side of the empire, leaving him to focus on the management of his particular domain.
[02:49 --> 02:54] Which was nice, because even though it was just a quarter of the empire, those domains
[02:54 --> 03:02] were still a pretty huge chunk of land, and millions of people still lived in them.
[03:02 --> 03:07] But of course, the division of imperial authority was not the end of Diocletian's reforms,
[03:07 --> 03:09] it was just the beginning.
[03:09 --> 03:14] In keeping with the theme of getting more people doing fewer things, Diocletian also
[03:14 --> 03:20] set about dividing up the empire into smaller, more manageable provinces.
[03:20 --> 03:25] Last week I focused on the military implications of this reformation, so this week I want to
[03:25 --> 03:28] focus on the administrative aspects.
[03:28 --> 03:32] There were basically three main things here that were of concern.
[03:32 --> 03:39] The collection of taxes, the administration of justice, and the maintenance of the infrastructure.
[03:39 --> 03:43] All three of these core missions had been more or less abandoned as the crisis years
[03:43 --> 03:49] wore on, and even before then the size of an individual province, which was big, and
[03:49 --> 03:54] the size of a provincial government, which was small, conspired to make most administrations
[03:54 --> 03:59] woefully inadequate with regards to all three anyway.
[03:59 --> 04:04] Sure taxes were collected and justice was administered, and the roads were maintained,
[04:04 --> 04:09] but not without delays, inefficiencies, and outright failures.
[04:09 --> 04:13] When it came to government, Diocletian didn't want to just set things back to the way they
[04:13 --> 04:19] had been, he wanted to make the whole operation better.
[04:19 --> 04:23] When Diocletian finished drawing his lines all over the map, and I have posted a map
[04:23 --> 04:29] of Diocletian's new provincial alignment at thehistoryofrome.titepad.com, the Romans
[04:29 --> 04:35] found that their empire now contained over a hundred provinces.
[04:35 --> 04:40] As with the larger division of the Tetrarchy, the proliferation of new provinces meant that,
[04:40 --> 04:44] simply put, governors had less to worry about.
[04:44 --> 04:48] And it was a good thing that they had less to worry about, because Diocletian was going
[04:48 --> 04:53] to expect more of them than any previous emperor had.
[04:53 --> 04:58] For example, he sent out instructions that he expected his governors to be active participants
[04:58 --> 05:00] in the judicial system.
[05:00 --> 05:06] They were not to ignore petitions or appeals, and they were not to hand them off to subordinates.
[05:06 --> 05:09] They had been made the supreme legal authority in their province, and they were damn well
[05:09 --> 05:11] going to act like it.
[05:11 --> 05:17] It used to be easy to shirk these responsibilities because the absolute flood of plaintiffs
[05:17 --> 05:22] and defendants who would come calling made for an easy excuse, but even the most conscientious
[05:22 --> 05:26] governor had no hope of dealing with it all himself.
[05:26 --> 05:33] So smaller provinces, and voila, a reasonably sized caseload.
[05:33 --> 05:37] I don't want to belabor these points because I think you get the general idea, but suffice
[05:37 --> 05:43] it to say that smaller provinces also meant that it was easier to track down tax evaders,
[05:43 --> 05:48] and it was easier to notice when a dilapidated building needed to be repaired.
[05:48 --> 05:56] More people focused on fewer things meant that fewer things were getting missed.
[05:56 --> 06:01] But of course, with all these little provinces running around, coordinating empire-wide initiatives
[06:01 --> 06:04] became a major headache.
[06:04 --> 06:08] So over and above the provincial governors, Diocletian created a whole new bureaucratic
[06:08 --> 06:16] level to help manage macro policy, and these were called the diocese.
[06:16 --> 06:21] The 100-odd provinces were collected into just 12 of these new diocese, and it was at
[06:21 --> 06:26] this level that the most basic policies of the Tantraarchy were implemented.
[06:26 --> 06:31] A diocese could be made up by as few as four provinces, as in the case of Britain, and
[06:31 --> 06:36] as many as 16, as in the case of the so-called Diocese of the East, which encompassed the
[06:36 --> 06:39] whole of the Eastern Mediterranean.
[06:39 --> 06:44] Their main function was to help enforce policy that was being handed down by the emperor,
[06:44 --> 06:50] and help oversee policy that was being enacted on the local level.
[06:50 --> 06:54] The men in charge of a diocese were called vicars, and they were officially listed as
[06:54 --> 06:59] the personal representative of the Praetorian Prefect, meaning that they were just about
[06:59 --> 07:04] as close to the emperor as you could get these days, which helped streamline the process
[07:04 --> 07:07] of rolling out new policies.
[07:07 --> 07:12] These novel new super districts were kept around in the East until Justinian decided
[07:12 --> 07:17] to abolish them and go back to the more powerful provincial governor model, but in the West
[07:17 --> 07:22] the diocese were taken over by the clergy, and formed the basis, even today, of Catholic
[07:22 --> 07:27] administration in Europe.
[07:27 --> 07:31] On the subject of macro policy, I want to insert a small correction for something I
[07:31 --> 07:35] said last week with regard to the new military duxes.
[07:35 --> 07:41] I said that given the smaller sizes of Diocletian's provinces, that the duxes only commanded small
[07:41 --> 07:46] contingents of soldiers, but the opposite was actually true.
[07:46 --> 07:52] A dux functioned more like a theater commander, who often oversaw multiple provinces' worth
[07:52 --> 07:58] of soldiers in order to maintain strategic coordination out on the frontiers.
[07:58 --> 08:02] Their ability to revolt was blunted not so much by the fact that they only commanded
[08:02 --> 08:07] a small number of troops, some duxes actually controlled 20,000 men or more, but rather
[08:07 --> 08:12] by the fact that they had no political powers and no private control over the tax and levy
[08:12 --> 08:17] system that they would need if they were going to fund and feed a revolt.
[08:17 --> 08:26] So I apologize for having denigrated the rank and dignity of the noble dux.
[08:26 --> 08:33] The point of adding new layers of administration was to try to get everyone on the same page.
[08:33 --> 08:38] Diocletian wanted the empire to function as one coordinated mechanism, with all parts
[08:38 --> 08:43] working in concert with one another, for the betterment of the whole.
[08:43 --> 08:50] To this end he also initiated two highly unpopular shifts, at least in the affected regions,
[08:50 --> 08:54] to make sure that no part of the empire thought it was somehow better or different than the
[08:54 --> 08:55] rest.
[08:55 --> 09:01] I am speaking, of course, of his treatment of two parts of the empire that most definitely
[09:01 --> 09:09] considered themselves better and different, Italy and Egypt.
[09:09 --> 09:14] As he was splitting up the provinces and appointing vicars, Diocletian decided that the time for
[09:14 --> 09:20] special treatment was over, and that henceforth everyone would be equal within what had become
[09:20 --> 09:25] in every single way a multinational empire.
[09:25 --> 09:29] The Italians, going back to the very beginning of Rome's expansion, had been exempt from
[09:29 --> 09:34] taxation and had always enjoyed certain other little perks that came with being the home
[09:34 --> 09:36] base of the empire.
[09:36 --> 09:39] But now that was over.
[09:39 --> 09:45] Divided into sixteen districts and watched over by a vicar, Italy was now treated just
[09:45 --> 09:48] like any other province.
[09:48 --> 09:52] Only the city of Rome itself maintained its exemption, one of the few deferential nods
[09:52 --> 09:59] Diocletian ever made to the birthplace of his empire.
[09:59 --> 10:04] Egypt on the other hand had always paid its taxes, though there was an awful lot of dodging
[10:04 --> 10:09] going on, but they had also been granted a degree of autonomy.
[10:09 --> 10:13] They were allowed to keep their own records, they ran off their own calendar, and perhaps
[10:13 --> 10:19] most importantly, they coined their own money at a mint in Alexandria.
[10:19 --> 10:25] All of this too was cancelled by Diocletian as he implemented his nice, clean, rational
[10:25 --> 10:32] order, free of exemptions, exceptions, preferential treatment, and special deals.
[10:32 --> 10:36] Maybe the empire could afford such things in good times, but the good times were long
[10:36 --> 10:38] gone.
[10:38 --> 10:43] It was time for everyone to pitch in equally.
[10:43 --> 10:49] For the senatorial aristocracy in Italy, the blows to their status were now coming fast
[10:49 --> 10:51] and furious.
[10:51 --> 10:56] Their power as a body had of course been stripped away by Augustus a long, long time ago, but
[10:56 --> 11:01] the pleasant fictions of the Principate had allowed senators to maintain some dignity
[11:01 --> 11:03] over the following centuries.
[11:03 --> 11:09] They ran provinces, they ratified decisions, and as individuals they joined in the administrations
[11:09 --> 11:12] of just about every emperor.
[11:12 --> 11:17] But now that too was all over.
[11:17 --> 11:22] Diocletian's vision of an autocratic, centrally planned, and centrally governed empire was
[11:22 --> 11:28] absolute, and he had no intention of letting a few wealthy Italians who used to be somebody,
[11:28 --> 11:33] we swear, get in his way.
[11:33 --> 11:37] His first and most obvious move towards eradicating the Senate from imperial affairs, as we've
[11:37 --> 11:42] already seen, was to simply never go to Rome.
[11:42 --> 11:48] Power is usually established by proximity to power, and the Senate was now, physically,
[11:48 --> 11:51] nowhere near power.
[11:51 --> 11:53] But Diocletian went further than that.
[11:53 --> 11:58] Previous emperors had allowed the Senate to continue running the old senatorial provinces
[11:58 --> 12:03] of the Augustan constitutional settlements, the most important of these being the provinces
[12:03 --> 12:06] of Africa and Asia.
[12:06 --> 12:11] They never wielded anything like final authority, but senators were appointed governors of these
[12:11 --> 12:17] provinces and the Senate as a body still deliberated what to do with them, with the full understanding
[12:17 --> 12:24] that any time the emperor wanted to, he could step in and do or undo whatever he wanted.
[12:24 --> 12:28] But still, they had a little tiny chip in the game.
[12:28 --> 12:34] When Diocletian reorganized the empire, though, that chip was taken away, as he obliterated
[12:34 --> 12:38] the old senatorial-imperial provincial distinction.
[12:38 --> 12:44] Plus, almost to a man, Diocletian's new provincial authorities were drawn from the equestrian
[12:44 --> 12:46] class.
[12:46 --> 12:52] He wanted smart, capable, career-minded men who owed their allegiance fully and completely
[12:52 --> 12:57] to the emperor to be the ones out in the field running the show.
[12:57 --> 13:02] The old aristocracy in Rome never quite gave up their sense of self-importance when they
[13:02 --> 13:08] gave up their power, and Diocletian did not trust them to fall into line without hesitation
[13:08 --> 13:11] or reservation.
[13:11 --> 13:14] The only notice he took of their feelings is that when he divided up Italy along with
[13:14 --> 13:20] the rest of the empire, he did allow senators to govern the individual Italian districts,
[13:20 --> 13:25] though they were overseen by an equestrian vicar.
[13:25 --> 13:29] From this point on, we see a shift in Roman politics.
[13:29 --> 13:34] Robbed of any role to play in the empire they had created, the senators in Rome fell back
[13:34 --> 13:38] into a merely local brand of politics.
[13:38 --> 13:43] No longer was the pinnacle of the senator's career the consulship, the governorship, or
[13:43 --> 13:44] the emperorship.
[13:44 --> 13:50] It was instead the city prefecture, the mayor of Rome.
[13:50 --> 13:54] Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
[13:54 --> 13:59] This was all undertaken, I think, not so much because Diocletian despised the senate, as
[13:59 --> 14:05] his attitude is sometimes reduced to, but instead because he disliked the untidiness
[14:05 --> 14:10] of the old Augustine pseudo-partnership with them.
[14:10 --> 14:14] Diocletian was, with every fiber of his being, an autocrat.
[14:14 --> 14:19] He was not the type of man like, say, Trajan had been, who encouraged his subordinates
[14:19 --> 14:23] to figure it out for themselves.
[14:23 --> 14:27] Trajan wanted to control every single little detail of imperial administration, and then
[14:27 --> 14:33] systematize that control so that it became permanent and unbreakable.
[14:33 --> 14:39] To this end, he created the largest centralized bureaucracy staffed by career civil servants
[14:39 --> 14:46] the western world had ever seen, and then let it run the empire.
[14:46 --> 14:52] In a later denunciation of Diocletian's policies, the bitterly hostile Christian writer Lactantius
[14:52 --> 14:59] who, as we'll soon see, had some very good reasons for being bitterly hostile, describes
[14:59 --> 15:04] the enlargement of the imperial bureaucracy as creating a situation where the number of
[15:04 --> 15:12] men being paid by the state was greater than the number of taxpayers paying into the state.
[15:12 --> 15:17] This is, of course, a gross exaggeration, but there is no denying that Diocletian effectively
[15:17 --> 15:21] doubled the number of civil servants over the course of his reign.
[15:21 --> 15:27] But that doubling was from around 15,000 to maybe 30,000 in an empire with a total
[15:27 --> 15:30] population of 20 to 50 million.
[15:30 --> 15:34] So no, there were not more bureaucrats than taxpayers.
[15:34 --> 15:40] But yes, there were a lot more salarymen running around today than there were yesterday, and
[15:40 --> 15:45] that did have a negative impact on the economy.
[15:45 --> 15:50] The other thing to keep in mind, though, is that the new bureaucracy was not necessarily
[15:50 --> 15:55] adding redundant layers to the administration of the empire.
[15:55 --> 16:01] During the crisis years, a local civic government had essentially ceased all operations.
[16:01 --> 16:06] All those town and city councils that had previously administered daily life had shuttered
[16:06 --> 16:10] their doors, and someone had to step into the void.
[16:10 --> 16:16] So enter the imperial bureaucrat.
[16:16 --> 16:22] The new bureaucracy was the flip side of that separation of civilian and military operations
[16:22 --> 16:24] we talked about last week.
[16:24 --> 16:30] Just as generals had gradually taken over the provincial governorships, the daily minutiae
[16:30 --> 16:35] of governance was taken over by career soldiers on their staffs as well.
[16:35 --> 16:40] Diocletian wanted to get the soldiers back to doing what they did best and bring in trained
[16:41 --> 16:46] to do the work the military had by necessity taken over.
[16:46 --> 16:51] But as he considered how the new administrative system was going to function, Diocletian decided
[16:51 --> 16:57] that the one thing he liked about the military being in charge was the clear chains of command,
[16:57 --> 17:03] the clear hierarchy of authority, and the clear specialization of function.
[17:03 --> 17:06] So when he kicked the soldiers back to the frontiers, he essentially kept the structure
[17:06 --> 17:14] of the military in place for his new bureaucracy, even as he staffed it with civilians.
[17:14 --> 17:18] Bureaucrats were grouped into cohorts, just like in the legions, made answerable to senior
[17:18 --> 17:24] officials who were in turn grouped together and made answerable to another senior official,
[17:24 --> 17:28] all the way up to the Praetorian prefect and the emperor.
[17:28 --> 17:33] To make sure that no one missed the point, Diocletian even made the official uniform
[17:33 --> 17:41] of his civil service a military cloak rather than a civilian toga.
[17:41 --> 17:45] Most of these officials served out in the provinces collecting taxes, maintaining the
[17:45 --> 17:50] public infrastructure, assessing property values, and so on and so on.
[17:50 --> 17:55] But everyone was angling for a promotion to where the action and money really was, working
[17:55 --> 18:01] directly for one of the emperors in one of the imperial capitals.
[18:01 --> 18:07] Where once a few informal advisors had helped the emperor shape policy and make decisions,
[18:07 --> 18:12] there was now a staff of literally thousands, carefully regimented into different departments,
[18:12 --> 18:20] all scurrying to and fro, issuing memoranda, making recommendations, and implementing policy.
[18:20 --> 18:25] These departments became known as Scrinia, named after the boxes the officials used to
[18:25 --> 18:30] hold all of their paperwork in while traveling with the emperor.
[18:30 --> 18:37] And there was a Scrinia for everything, foreign affairs, protocol, correspondence in Latin,
[18:37 --> 18:44] correspondence in Greek, petitions, favors, law, finance, on and on.
[18:44 --> 18:51] Each Scrinia had a department head, the equivalent of a cabinet minister or a cabinet secretary,
[18:51 --> 18:57] who when grouped together became known as the consistory, the permanent body of advisors
[18:57 --> 18:59] who surrounded the emperor.
[18:59 --> 19:03] The most important of all these officials, and the one who was really in charge of running
[19:03 --> 19:10] the show on a day-to-day basis, was the Praetorian prefect, who in terms of power, both de facto
[19:10 --> 19:15] and du jour, was second only to the emperor.
[19:15 --> 19:21] The office of Praetorian prefect had, over the years, evolved well beyond simply being
[19:21 --> 19:24] the captain of the imperial bodyguard.
[19:24 --> 19:29] Lucius Sejanus had been the first to assume administrative and political functions, and
[19:29 --> 19:34] for the next century and a half, the trajectory of the office had been consistently away from
[19:34 --> 19:40] its old military functions and towards an exclusively political one.
[19:40 --> 19:45] When Septimius Severus disbanded and then reformed the Praetorians, though, the prefects once
[19:45 --> 19:48] again wielded real military authority.
[19:48 --> 19:54] But when Diocletian took power, the Praetorians were reformed once more, this time reduced
[19:54 --> 19:59] to simply serving as the local city garrison of Rome, which, as you'll recall, put them
[19:59 --> 20:03] nowhere near the emperor or power.
[20:03 --> 20:09] But the office of Praetorian prefect was maintained, for, I guess, sentimental reasons, and Diocletian
[20:09 --> 20:15] placed the prefect squarely at the top of his new bureaucracy.
[20:15 --> 20:21] In effect, the prefect became a vice-emperor, and it was his job to make sure that the vast
[20:21 --> 20:27] new bureaucracy, including the hundreds of staffers that he personally employed, ran
[20:27 --> 20:30] as smoothly as it could.
[20:30 --> 20:35] But even more than that, his job was to share in the emperor's workload.
[20:35 --> 20:39] For most agenda items, the signature of the prefect was just as good as the signature
[20:39 --> 20:44] of the emperor, which meant that twice as much could now be done in the same amount
[20:44 --> 20:46] of time.
[20:46 --> 20:51] In the later part of his reign, Diocletian even went so far as to issue an edict stating
[20:51 --> 20:57] that judicial decisions issued by the prefect were no longer appealable to the emperor.
[20:57 --> 21:01] You could appeal to the emperor, or you could appeal to the prefect, but you couldn't do
[21:01 --> 21:03] both.
[21:03 --> 21:10] The prefect was, in short, a really, really powerful guy, and not at all someone you wanted
[21:10 --> 21:14] to mess with.
[21:14 --> 21:17] So those are the basics of the bureaucracy.
[21:17 --> 21:22] Regional agents out in the field were answerable to the officials who ran the regional offices,
[21:22 --> 21:26] who were answerable to their superiors in the cabinet ministries, who were answerable
[21:26 --> 21:31] to the department heads, who were answerable to the praetorian prefect, who was answerable
[21:31 --> 21:33] to the emperor.
[21:33 --> 21:39] Throw in the parallel and sometimes intertwined tracks that introduced provincial governors
[21:39 --> 21:45] and vicars of the diocese, and what you get is a hugely expanded, centrally run civil
[21:45 --> 21:50] service that now governed the whole empire with its own code of ethics, standards, and
[21:50 --> 21:53] loyalties.
[21:53 --> 21:59] The famously ritualized and labyrinth administrations that came to define the Byzantine Empire,
[21:59 --> 22:05] and indeed gave rise to the adjective Byzantine to describe something so multi-layered, overly
[22:05 --> 22:10] complicated and self-perpetuating that it confounds the mind, found its first form back
[22:11 --> 22:16] in the years of the tetrarchy, as Diocletian sought to bring back adequate governance to
[22:16 --> 22:21] the empire.
[22:21 --> 22:25] The one thing we haven't really talked about, though, is perhaps Diocletian's most famous
[22:25 --> 22:32] reform of all, the nature of the imperial office itself.
[22:32 --> 22:36] I mentioned something about it when I was discussing Diocletian's desire to rest his
[22:36 --> 22:41] legitimacy on divine authority rather than the approval of the legions or the consent
[22:41 --> 22:47] of the senate, but I didn't really talk about how it worked in practice, how Diocletian
[22:47 --> 22:54] on a daily basis transformed the principate into the dominant.
[22:54 --> 23:00] At its most basic level, the transformation took place on a physical level, and it was
[23:00 --> 23:05] from these physical changes that Diocletian expected the psychology of his subjects to
[23:05 --> 23:08] shift.
[23:08 --> 23:14] First and foremost, access to the emperor was severely restricted.
[23:14 --> 23:20] He was kept secluded behind doors and officials and guards and more doors and more officials
[23:20 --> 23:25] and more guards and then long hallways and more doors, until by the time you actually
[23:25 --> 23:31] got to the emperor, it was like you were setting foot in some holy inner sanctum.
[23:31 --> 23:37] The principate had been predicated on a calculated intimacy, with emperors going out of their
[23:37 --> 23:42] way to show that they were just one of the guys, whether inviting senators over for dinner
[23:42 --> 23:45] or sharing in the hardships of the soldiers.
[23:45 --> 23:51] Now it was the exact opposite, with calculated aloofness creating the impression that the
[23:51 --> 23:56] emperor was a near mythical figure.
[23:56 --> 24:01] Gibbon remarked that Augustus's model sought to conceal the real power of the emperors,
[24:01 --> 24:04] while Diocletians sought to display it.
[24:04 --> 24:09] And by keeping the emperor hidden from view, the people's imaginations, with regards to
[24:09 --> 24:18] the extent of his almost supernatural powers, began to run freely.
[24:18 --> 24:21] Beyond this, there were dozens of subtle shifts.
[24:21 --> 24:27] When the consistory met, all the ministers stood while the emperor remained seated.
[24:27 --> 24:32] You'll recall that Julius Caesar's fate was practically sealed when he failed to rise
[24:32 --> 24:38] to meet a delegation from the senate, so this was actually a pretty big deal.
[24:38 --> 24:43] Upon meeting with the emperor, it was expected that you kiss his robe as a sign of submission,
[24:43 --> 24:48] something that would have been absolutely offensive to the Romans of old.
[24:48 --> 24:53] But even more offensive might have been the reappearance of that universal symbol of royal
[24:53 --> 25:02] authority, the diadem, which he took to wearing along with rich and bejeweled royal robes.
[25:02 --> 25:06] The point of all this, as I mentioned before, was not so that Diocletian could indulge his
[25:06 --> 25:12] vanity or his megalomania, but so that he could impress upon his subjects that the emperor
[25:12 --> 25:15] was indeed above and beyond them.
[25:15 --> 25:21] He literally shimmered in the light, never rising from his throne as supplicants cautiously
[25:21 --> 25:24] approached to kiss his robes.
[25:24 --> 25:29] The empire needed a strong authority figure to reassert order over an empire that had
[25:29 --> 25:37] nearly come crashing down, and Diocletian aimed to give it to them in spades.
[25:37 --> 25:41] The emperor was no longer Princeps, the first citizen.
[25:41 --> 25:51] He was Dominus, the lord of the empire, and there would be no going back.
[25:51 --> 25:56] Taken together, Diocletian's reordering of the governmental apparatus ushered in a whole
[25:56 --> 26:01] new era for the Roman Empire, and did nothing less than set the stage for the Byzantine
[26:01 --> 26:06] Empire that would carry on Rome's legacy into the Middle Ages.
[26:06 --> 26:10] All pretense of public government had now been cast aside.
[26:10 --> 26:15] All claims of regional autonomy had now been cast aside.
[26:15 --> 26:19] And any hint that the emperor might not be some sort of demigod ruling from a divine
[26:19 --> 26:23] palace in the sky had definitely been cast aside.
[26:23 --> 26:30] Perhaps, most importantly, by abandoning Rome as the capital and reorganizing Italy as just
[26:30 --> 26:37] another province, the Roman Empire was finally cut adrift from its Roman heritage.
[26:37 --> 26:42] Which is, incidentally, how the East was able to keep right on going even after Rome itself
[26:42 --> 26:46] had fallen into barbarism.
[26:46 --> 26:52] The empire was now, more than ever, a single unit, commanded from the center, and functioning
[26:52 --> 26:58] for the betterment of the whole without regard to tradition, feelings, or even private interest.
[26:58 --> 27:02] No more was it first citizen and fellow citizens.
[27:02 --> 27:12] It was now ruler and ruled, plain, simple, and laid bare for all to see.
[27:13 --> 27:18] Next week, we will see how much this new dynamic of ruler and ruled came to alter the daily
[27:18 --> 27:24] lives of the citizens, as Diocletian will seek to control not just the apparatus that
[27:24 --> 27:29] govern them, but the economy that they swam in.
[27:29 --> 27:34] And it was here that he finally met his match, because if there was one field Diocletian
[27:34 --> 27:37] failed to master, it was economics.

[00:04 --> 00:11] Hello, and welcome to The History of Rome, Episode 69, A History of Rome Wedding.
[00:13 --> 00:16] So The History of Rome is getting married in a week and a half, and to celebrate, today
[00:16 --> 00:21] we're going to set aside the steady march of history and do a short episode focused
[00:21 --> 00:22] on Roman wedding customs.
[00:23 --> 00:27] Remember also that after today, we'll be going off the air for four weeks while
[00:28 --> 00:31] The History of Rome, do the thing where we get married, and then do the thing where we
[00:31 --> 00:33] move to Austin, Texas.
[00:34 --> 00:39] When we come back though, we'll do the rockum sockum drama of 69 AD, and then move into
[00:39 --> 00:43] the Flavian dynasty on our way to the Five Good Emperors, the decline phase into the
[00:43 --> 00:48] crisis of the third century, and the surprising comeback led by Diocletian and
[00:48 --> 00:49] confirmed by Constantine.
[00:50 --> 00:53] Lots and lots still to come, so please stay tuned.
[00:54 --> 00:57] Today though, we've got weddings on the brain.
[00:58 --> 01:03] Yesterday we finalized the floral arrangements, picked up my suit from the tailor, scrambled
[01:03 --> 01:08] for a workable solution to the wedding cake issue, and, gulp, went down to the giant
[01:08 --> 01:12] brick building to pay for and sign an official wedding certificate that will formally
[01:12 --> 01:16] make us husband and wife once it's signed by the state sanctioned officiant who
[01:16 --> 01:17] will perform the wedding ceremony.
[01:18 --> 01:23] As it turns out, weddings are a confusing amalgam of emotion, tradition, and bureaucratic
[01:23 --> 01:24] legalese.
[01:25 --> 01:28] If that doesn't sound like the Romans, well, I don't know what does.
[01:29 --> 01:32] It goes without saying that we have them to thank for a lot of what we all have
[01:32 --> 01:34] to put up with when it's time to get married.
[01:36 --> 01:41] As an institution, marriage dates back into prehistory and was codified as a legal
[01:41 --> 01:45] relationship as early as Hammurabi's Code in the 1700s BC.
[01:45 --> 01:50] There are competing theories about where the institution came from and why it persists,
[01:50 --> 01:54] and I'm basically not going to touch any of that with a ten-foot pole, but I'm
[01:54 --> 01:57] just going to say that by the time the Romans came onto the scene, marriage was
[01:57 --> 02:00] a well-established rock upon which society was based.
[02:01 --> 02:06] It was the manner by which property, wealth, rights, responsibilities, and alliances
[02:06 --> 02:09] were transferred from one generation to another.
[02:10 --> 02:14] Because all of this formed the bedrock of an enduring culture, as with most of
[02:14 --> 02:19] the ancient world, marriage in Rome was not seen as the legal expression of love
[02:19 --> 02:23] and commitment, but rather as the practical means to a practical end.
[02:24 --> 02:28] The very idea of romantic love was so divorced from the concept of marriage,
[02:28 --> 02:32] in fact, that those who stumbled into a union that actually involved romantic
[02:32 --> 02:36] love, as with Pompey the Great and Julia, they found themselves the
[02:36 --> 02:39] butts of jokes rather than celebrated as models to be emulated.
[02:40 --> 02:45] At all levels of society, Roman marriage was about cementing connections between
[02:45 --> 02:49] families, securing and consolidating property, and creating clear legal lines
[02:49 --> 02:51] of succession and inheritance.
[02:52 --> 02:54] Love was left to poets and philosophers.
[02:55 --> 02:57] Marriage was a serious business.
[02:59 --> 03:02] There were different types of marriage in ancient Rome, but they broke down
[03:02 --> 03:03] into two broad categories.
[03:04 --> 03:08] Marriages where the bride was transferred as property from her father
[03:08 --> 03:11] to her new husband, and those where she technically remained under the
[03:11 --> 03:13] authority of her existing paterfamilias.
[03:15 --> 03:19] The former category itself broke down into three types, one which was elaborate
[03:19 --> 03:23] and formal, a second which was less formal but involved the ceremonial
[03:23 --> 03:27] purchase of a bride by the groom, and one which was a sort of variation of
[03:27 --> 03:31] today's common law marriage that only kicked in once a woman had been
[03:31 --> 03:33] living with a single man for more than a year.
[03:34 --> 03:38] The second category, where the wife was not formally subordinated to her new
[03:38 --> 03:42] husband, was known as a free marriage, and in some cases the woman became
[03:42 --> 03:46] subordinate only to herself if their father died and had stipulated such
[03:46 --> 03:48] freedom in the will.
[03:50 --> 03:55] Roman women, or should I say Roman girls, were eligible for marriage at 12,
[03:55 --> 03:59] and Roman men, or should I say Roman punk teenagers, were ready at 14.
[04:00 --> 04:04] Most of the time marriages were set up between boys and girls close in age,
[04:04 --> 04:08] but often an older man marrying for the second or third time would choose
[04:08 --> 04:09] a much younger wife.
[04:10 --> 04:14] Though there was no real legal restrictions to this, or even very
[04:14 --> 04:17] strict social taboos, men like Cicero still found themselves made
[04:17 --> 04:21] fun of for the huge age discrepancies between themselves and
[04:21 --> 04:22] their chosen wives.
[04:23 --> 04:27] What really was taboo though was for a man to marry a woman older
[04:27 --> 04:30] than him, and it was a striking exception that Octavian's first
[04:30 --> 04:32] marriage was to the much older Scriabonia.
[04:34 --> 04:38] The matches would be arranged by the paterfamiliae, or fathers of the
[04:38 --> 04:40] family, of the prospective bride and groom.
[04:41 --> 04:44] Though the women of the families did not officially have any say in
[04:44 --> 04:48] who would marry their sons and daughters, Roman matrons did exert
[04:48 --> 04:50] considerable informal power over the process.
[04:51 --> 04:54] Particularly in the case of brides, it was customary for the
[04:54 --> 04:58] paterfamilias to consult with the mother of the bride when working up
[04:58 --> 05:00] a list of potential candidates for her daughter to marry.
[05:01 --> 05:04] The paterfamilias was not of course legally obligated to consult
[05:04 --> 05:08] with the mother of the bride, but you know, he did so at his own peril.
[05:10 --> 05:13] In order for a marriage to be arranged and recognized, both the
[05:13 --> 05:17] groom-to-be and bride-to-be were required to have something called
[05:17 --> 05:19] canubium, or the right to marry.
[05:20 --> 05:23] Basically, this meant answering the questions, are they old enough?
[05:24 --> 05:25] Are they Roman citizens?
[05:26 --> 05:28] And are they presently married to someone else?
[05:29 --> 05:33] The Romans had no truck with polygamy as it muddled up inheritance lines,
[05:33 --> 05:36] and they did not, except under certain special circumstances,
[05:36 --> 05:38] recognize marriage to foreigners.
[05:39 --> 05:41] As you will recall, this latter point formed the basis for
[05:41 --> 05:45] Octavian's attacks on Marc Antony after Antony took up with
[05:45 --> 05:49] the foreigner Cleopatra at the expense of his citizen wife Octavia.
[05:50 --> 05:54] But beyond these technical requirements that answered the question,
[05:54 --> 05:57] can I marry this man, or can I marry this woman?
[05:57 --> 05:59] There was the social requirements.
[05:59 --> 06:02] Should I marry this man, or should I marry this woman?
[06:04 --> 06:06] In the upper classes, this was especially important.
[06:06 --> 06:09] But up and down the line, Roman mothers and
[06:09 --> 06:12] fathers fretted over finding the right match for their children.
[06:12 --> 06:16] That husband or that wife who would elevate their social status or
[06:16 --> 06:20] bring in a particularly large dowry or gain them entrance into a prominent family.
[06:23 --> 06:26] In the early days, you'll recall that there were all kinds of rules about who
[06:26 --> 06:30] could marry who, with patricians and plebs not allowed to intermarry.
[06:31 --> 06:34] When those restrictions were lifted, it became a really big deal for
[06:34 --> 06:37] a plebeian family to hook one of their daughters up to a patrician man,
[06:38 --> 06:40] or to bring a patrician daughter into their house.
[06:41 --> 06:44] On the other side though, the patricians were never particularly excited
[06:44 --> 06:48] to be sending one of their own off to join a plebeian family, or
[06:48 --> 06:51] to be bringing in some commoner into their distinguished line.
[06:52 --> 06:56] But practical economics trumped aristocratic snobbery, as the cross-cast
[06:56 --> 06:59] unions usually proved to be economic windfalls for
[06:59 --> 07:01] many impoverished patrician families.
[07:03 --> 07:05] After all the centuries of intermarriage, by the time of the late
[07:05 --> 07:09] republic and early empire, the most important thing was not necessarily
[07:09 --> 07:12] whether a candidate was patrician or pleb, but
[07:12 --> 07:15] how distinguished their ancestral line was.
[07:16 --> 07:20] For the upper classes, it was all about counting the offices held by your ancestors.
[07:21 --> 07:24] If you were a young man from a distinguished family, who could point
[07:24 --> 07:27] to, say, four consul ships and 16 praetor ships held by your
[07:27 --> 07:30] various ancestors, then you were looking pretty good.
[07:31 --> 07:33] Bonus points were given or taken away,
[07:33 --> 07:35] depending on how recently such offices were held.
[07:36 --> 07:38] So if the young bride's father had been a consul,
[07:38 --> 07:41] then that would be a pretty sought after young woman.
[07:41 --> 07:45] But if her family was still clinging to the one consul ship they had held in
[07:45 --> 07:49] 436 BC, well, people were just going to roll their eyes at that.
[07:50 --> 07:54] Over the course of the Second Punic War, most of the upper class men who
[07:54 --> 07:57] could point to distinguished lineages were wiped out, and
[07:57 --> 07:59] Rome saw the arrival of the novice homo,
[07:59 --> 08:02] which led to the wholesale intermingling of lines.
[08:03 --> 08:06] The young man who sought to be the first in his family to reach the
[08:06 --> 08:09] consul ship, sought a bride who would connect him into a prominent,
[08:09 --> 08:11] if depleted aristocratic family.
[08:12 --> 08:16] And that same aristocratic family was looking for men of merit, and
[08:16 --> 08:20] more importantly, men of wealth, who would help maintain the family's
[08:20 --> 08:21] place at the top of the food chain.
[08:23 --> 08:25] A perfect example of this is Gaius Marius,
[08:25 --> 08:29] a young pavilion man of talent and ambition, whose marriage into the
[08:29 --> 08:32] ancient but floundering Julian line took his career and
[08:32 --> 08:35] their political status to the next level.
[08:36 --> 08:39] The lower classes worked in much the same way, but
[08:39 --> 08:42] instead of playing in the VIP room, they played at the dollar tables,
[08:42 --> 08:44] not that the competition was any less fierce.
[08:46 --> 08:49] Everyone was trying to find the perfect match to raise the whole family up from
[08:49 --> 08:53] where they had been previously, politically, economically, and socially.
[08:54 --> 08:57] One of the overriding goals of a Roman man was to outdo the
[08:57 --> 09:01] accomplishments of his ancestors, and marriage was another tool in his kit
[09:01 --> 09:03] to help him accomplish this ever present goal.
[09:05 --> 09:08] Beyond the lineage stuff and the economic stuff,
[09:09 --> 09:13] character actually played a pretty large role in the selection of brides and grooms.
[09:14 --> 09:17] Roman society centered around public praise and public shame.
[09:18 --> 09:22] So the serious young man who seemed to be a natural leader of men
[09:22 --> 09:26] was more prized than the lazy man who seemed to be a natural drinker of drink.
[09:27 --> 09:31] The former would create maximum praise, the latter maximum shame.
[09:32 --> 09:36] For the women, it was all about being a dutiful, obedient, and loyal wife.
[09:38 --> 09:41] Outspoken, uninhibited women were looked upon with suspicion,
[09:41 --> 09:45] as again, the former would bring much praise, the latter much shame.
[09:47 --> 09:49] As I think continues to be the case today,
[09:50 --> 09:53] physical beauty was more highly sought after in women than in men.
[09:54 --> 09:58] A pretty girl from a nobody family could catch the eye of some rich aristocrat
[09:58 --> 10:01] and suddenly find herself elevating her family well above their rank
[10:01 --> 10:03] as a result of a marriage proposal.
[10:05 --> 10:08] For the man from nowhere though, good looks were not his ticket to the top,
[10:08 --> 10:09] but rather his promise.
[10:10 --> 10:14] If he thought well and spoke well and carried himself well and
[10:14 --> 10:18] possessed an ambition to succeed in public life, he might just find himself
[10:18 --> 10:21] skipping ahead of men with better pedigrees, but worse habits.
[10:24 --> 10:27] Once a marriage was arranged, it was time to announce the happy news.
[10:28 --> 10:31] One way a new couple could signal their intention to marry was to simply
[10:31 --> 10:33] appear in public holding hands.
[10:34 --> 10:37] But often, a formal engagement party was thrown by the paterfamilias of
[10:37 --> 10:40] the bride with the groom to be seated as the guest of honor.
[10:41 --> 10:44] At this party, the couple formally announced their consent to be wed,
[10:45 --> 10:47] and the final details of the dowry, if there was one,
[10:48 --> 10:50] were worked out between the two paterfamilii.
[10:51 --> 10:53] As a visible symbol of the engagement,
[10:53 --> 10:56] brides-to-be would often be given engagement rings, which they would wear,
[10:56 --> 10:59] as they do today, on the ring finger of the left hand,
[11:00 --> 11:02] believed to be linked directly with the heart.
[11:02 --> 11:05] So I suppose I can't say that it was all business.
[11:07 --> 11:10] Though a formal ceremony was not required to legalize a marriage,
[11:10 --> 11:12] a wedding was as good a time as any to throw a party.
[11:13 --> 11:16] So the happy occasion was often celebrated with a ceremony and
[11:16 --> 11:19] reception held at the father of the bride's house.
[11:20 --> 11:24] When picking out a day for the ceremony, the superstitious Romans
[11:24 --> 11:28] studiously avoided the calends, knowns, and ides of any given month,
[11:28 --> 11:32] which, for example, would be the 1st, 5th, and 13th of September,
[11:33 --> 11:36] and refused to marry in the unlucky months of February and May.
[11:37 --> 11:39] June was considered to be the best month within which to marry,
[11:39 --> 11:43] which may be the origin of the old a June bride expression.
[11:44 --> 11:46] Once they successfully navigated the luck and
[11:46 --> 11:50] unluck of the calendar, the families would set the date and
[11:50 --> 11:51] send out invitations.
[11:52 --> 11:55] For these types of aristocratic weddings, ten people were required
[11:55 --> 11:57] to attend to fulfill the witness requirement.
[11:59 --> 12:02] On the day of the wedding, the bride would ritually give away all her
[12:02 --> 12:06] childhood toys and clothes, and then be dressed by her mother in
[12:06 --> 12:10] a single piece floor length white gown with a ceremonial knotted belt
[12:10 --> 12:13] believed to bring good luck that only her new husband could undo.
[12:14 --> 12:17] Her hair would be parted by a ceremonial spear tip,
[12:17 --> 12:20] be separated into six locks, and then topped by a floral veil.
[12:22 --> 12:25] The groom, his family, and other guests would arrive in the father of
[12:25 --> 12:29] the bride's home, and after the auspices were taken one more time
[12:29 --> 12:31] to ensure that all was well metaphysically,
[12:32 --> 12:34] the parents of the bride would hand her over to the groom.
[12:35 --> 12:37] During the ceremony, the bride and
[12:37 --> 12:39] groom would stand before a priest, holding hands, and
[12:39 --> 12:42] they would exchange vows that usually included the line,
[12:42 --> 12:45] where you are Gaius, I am Gaia.
[12:45 --> 12:48] Gaius being a name that held some particular luck for
[12:48 --> 12:49] these types of occasions.
[12:50 --> 12:53] After the vows were exchanged, the couple would offer a sacrifice
[12:53 --> 12:55] to Jupiter in the form of either a pig or,
[12:55 --> 12:58] as most of us are now used to, some type of cake.
[13:00 --> 13:02] Following the signing of the paperwork and
[13:02 --> 13:05] exchange of presents, the guests would sit down to a meal and
[13:05 --> 13:08] prepare themselves for the upcoming wedding procession.
[13:09 --> 13:12] The procession was the key to the whole shebang and
[13:12 --> 13:15] served as the ritual transference of authority from the father of
[13:15 --> 13:16] the bride to the husband.
[13:17 --> 13:21] The bride would be guided out of her father's house by three boys,
[13:21 --> 13:24] and would lead the guests on a walk to her new husband's home.
[13:25 --> 13:28] One of these boys would bear a torte that signified her father's
[13:28 --> 13:31] authority over her, lit from the patter familiar's hearth.
[13:33 --> 13:34] As the procession wound through the streets,
[13:34 --> 13:38] the train would grow larger and larger, as the general public,
[13:38 --> 13:40] often just for the fun of it, joined in the march.
[13:41 --> 13:45] Along the way, onlookers would throw nuts, a symbol of fertility.
[13:47 --> 13:50] At some point in all of this, the groom would split off from the party and
[13:50 --> 13:51] hurry ahead to his house,
[13:51 --> 13:54] where he would formally greet his new wife into their home.
[13:55 --> 13:58] When she arrived at the threshold, some more rituals were performed,
[13:58 --> 14:01] including the ceremonial snuffing out of the torch and
[14:01 --> 14:02] tossing it to the assembled guests.
[14:03 --> 14:05] And then the bride would carefully step through the door.
[14:06 --> 14:09] The Romans were particularly superstitious about doorways,
[14:09 --> 14:11] though, and just as often as not,
[14:11 --> 14:14] the husband would pick up his new wife and carry her inside.
[14:14 --> 14:16] So that she did not trip on her way in,
[14:16 --> 14:19] which would have been a sign that the gods did not approve of the union.
[14:20 --> 14:23] Once inside, the general public would go about their business,
[14:23 --> 14:26] while the wedding guests would continue to feast and celebrate.
[14:27 --> 14:30] When the time came, the couple would head off to a ceremoniously
[14:30 --> 14:32] decorated wedding bed and consummate the marriage.
[14:34 --> 14:35] Though not legally required,
[14:35 --> 14:38] consummation on the night of the wedding was expected and
[14:38 --> 14:41] signaled that the two now held between them a contract of fidelity.
[14:42 --> 14:45] The next morning, the bride would emerge from their room and
[14:45 --> 14:49] begin her new life as a matron in her husband's family.
[14:50 --> 14:53] Though affection and kinship kept her tied to her old family,
[14:53 --> 14:56] legally, she was now the property of her husband.
[14:57 --> 14:59] It goes without saying that the very, very soon to be Mrs.
[15:00 --> 15:04] History of Rome does not subscribe to this theory at all, even in jest.
[15:04 --> 15:07] I'm serious, make that joke around here sometime.
[15:08 --> 15:10] So that's how the Romans got married.
[15:10 --> 15:14] The modern western world still holds to some of the traditions or
[15:14 --> 15:15] variations thereof.
[15:15 --> 15:18] And everything that I just described actually seems pretty similar to
[15:18 --> 15:21] everything that I'm planning on doing in a few weeks.
[15:21 --> 15:25] The engagement ring, the white dress, the veil, the offering of cake,
[15:25 --> 15:28] the throwing of rice, the tossing of a bouquet.
[15:28 --> 15:32] Like so much else in our culture, because that's how the Romans did it,
[15:32 --> 15:36] is the answer to the question of why we do all of the crazy things that we
[15:36 --> 15:38] do when it's time to get married.
[15:39 --> 15:41] So that's it for now.
[15:41 --> 15:45] I'll see you all again in four weeks from the new head office in Austin, Texas.
[15:45 --> 15:48] I want to thank everyone for their well wishes on the wedding and the move.
[15:48 --> 15:50] And to those of you who have donated money,
[15:50 --> 15:53] I want to say that none of it would have been possible without you.
[15:53 --> 15:56] I haven't touched a dime of the money that has come in and
[15:56 --> 15:59] it's been sitting in a honeymoon fund that has in the past few months
[15:59 --> 16:01] been renamed the moving fund.
[16:02 --> 16:04] To those of you who have thought about donating but
[16:04 --> 16:07] maybe haven't gotten around to it, well, we're about to pick up and
[16:07 --> 16:10] move across the country and technically neither one of us has landed a job yet.
[16:11 --> 16:13] So yeah, now's the time.
[16:13 --> 16:16] Thehistoryofrome.typepad.com.
[16:16 --> 16:17] Jupiter smiles on all of you.

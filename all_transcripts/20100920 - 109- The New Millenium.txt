[00:00 --> 00:14] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome, Episode 109, The New Millennium.
[00:14 --> 00:20] In 243 AD, eighteen-year-old Gordian III lost the man who would help make the first few
[00:20 --> 00:23] years of his reign a success.
[00:23 --> 00:28] With Timosithius in place, the empire had enjoyed the fruits of a capable administrator
[00:28 --> 00:32] without having to ingest the poisoned seeds that often accompany those fruits when they
[00:32 --> 00:36] are provided by too powerful an underling.
[00:36 --> 00:40] Had Gordian's father-in-law and Praetorian prefect lived, there might have been conflict
[00:40 --> 00:45] down the road as Gordian came of age, but we need not trouble ourselves with that question
[00:45 --> 00:48] because that's not how it went.
[00:48 --> 00:53] How it went was that things were going great for Gordian until Timosithius died and then
[00:53 --> 00:57] everything went to hell.
[00:57 --> 01:02] There are a couple of different versions about what happened between 243 and 244 that
[01:02 --> 01:07] led to Philip the Arab becoming emperor, but the basic facts are these.
[01:07 --> 01:13] Timosithius died, Philip was appointed Praetorian prefect, then Gordian died, and Philip became
[01:13 --> 01:15] emperor.
[01:15 --> 01:19] Other than that, the record is contradictory, but the different stories used to explain
[01:19 --> 01:24] these basic facts break down into roughly three categories.
[01:24 --> 01:28] One, Philip was completely innocent in everything that happened.
[01:28 --> 01:32] Two, Philip started out innocent but wound up guilty.
[01:32 --> 01:37] And three, that Philip was guilty right on down the line.
[01:37 --> 01:41] To take the last first, the story goes that Philip and his brother Gaius conspired to
[01:41 --> 01:47] kill Timosithius, that is, the mysterious illness that killed Gordian's father-in-law
[01:47 --> 01:49] was actually poison.
[01:49 --> 01:54] Then, once Philip was prefect, the brothers conspired to kill Gordian and have the guard
[01:54 --> 01:56] elect Philip emperor.
[01:56 --> 02:01] Call that version Philip the Archmachevelian.
[02:01 --> 02:06] Version two is that Timosithius died of natural causes and it was only after Philip became
[02:06 --> 02:11] prefect that he and his brother decided to make a play for the empire by killing Gordian.
[02:11 --> 02:15] Call that version Philip the opportunist.
[02:15 --> 02:20] The last version is that Philip had nothing to do with either death and was as surprised
[02:20 --> 02:24] as anyone to find the Praetorians elevating him to the purple.
[02:24 --> 02:28] Call that version Gordian the lucky.
[02:28 --> 02:33] The Romans themselves clearly believed some combination of Philip the opportunist and
[02:33 --> 02:39] Philip the Archmachevelian, and the characterization of Philip as a complete innocent likely wouldn't
[02:39 --> 02:45] exist were it not for the curious case of the missing battle.
[02:45 --> 02:51] In early 244 AD, Persian histories describe a battle taking place in Mesopotamia between
[02:51 --> 02:57] the Romans and the Sassanids that is almost nowhere described in the Latin record.
[02:57 --> 03:01] The Persian version has it that Sharpoor led an attack against the legions and that not
[03:01 --> 03:07] only were the legions defeated, but that Gordian himself fell in battle.
[03:07 --> 03:11] It is easy to dismiss this version as being propaganda invented by Sharpoor to embellish
[03:11 --> 03:16] his own record, but it is not exactly out of the question that the Romans would try
[03:16 --> 03:21] to bury the truth that the legions had been beaten and Gordian had been killed in battle
[03:21 --> 03:25] for propaganda reasons of their own.
[03:25 --> 03:30] I'm not going to pretend like I can settle this issue myself, and officially the cause
[03:30 --> 03:33] of Gordian's death remains unknown to this day.
[03:33 --> 03:37] But as I said, the Romans themselves certainly believed that Philip assassinated the young
[03:37 --> 03:41] emperor and I'm going to stick with that interpretation.
[03:41 --> 03:47] Besides, there is a very low likelihood that, covered up defeat or no, Gordian would have
[03:47 --> 03:53] been anywhere near a battlefield at that point in his career.
[03:53 --> 03:57] So the generally accepted version among the Romans is that after the war with the Sassanids
[03:57 --> 04:02] was shut down following the death of Timosifius, that Philip assassinated Gordian while the
[04:02 --> 04:07] imperial court was traveling around near the Euphrates River.
[04:07 --> 04:11] With the emperor dead, no one else ready to make an immediate bid for the throne and Philip
[04:11 --> 04:13] right there on the scene.
[04:13 --> 04:17] The Praetorian Guard followed the precedent set by Macrinus' men and elevated their
[04:17 --> 04:21] prefect to the top spot in the empire.
[04:21 --> 04:26] Word quickly spread and before anyone could do anything about it, Rome had its second
[04:26 --> 04:30] emperor of equestrian rank.
[04:30 --> 04:34] The lack of a good credible record makes it hard to figure exactly the order of events
[04:34 --> 04:39] and doesn't do much to explain how exactly Gordian died or why there was so little initial
[04:39 --> 04:41] resistance to Philip's ascension.
[04:41 --> 04:46] So at the end of the day, we have to simply accept the fact that Gordian died and Philip
[04:46 --> 04:50] became emperor and that he then reigned for five years.
[04:50 --> 04:55] We at least know that much.
[04:55 --> 05:00] Like his equestrian predecessor Macrinus, Philip was worried about having to deal with a war
[05:00 --> 05:06] in the east right at the outset of his reign and so shortly after becoming emperor he brokered
[05:06 --> 05:10] a more permanent ceasefire with the Sassanids.
[05:10 --> 05:14] While Sharpoor had been beaten soundly by Timosifius, Philip was wary of pressing the
[05:14 --> 05:19] Roman case beyond the Euphrates, especially since he needed to head west and consolidate
[05:19 --> 05:21] his hold on power.
[05:21 --> 05:26] Plus, there is that missing battle out there that may or may not have been enough to convince
[05:26 --> 05:31] the Roman high command to sue for peace.
[05:31 --> 05:36] Philip sent ambassadors to the court of Sharpoor in 244 and once again the Romans agreed to
[05:36 --> 05:41] purchase a peace that they had no interest in fighting for.
[05:41 --> 05:46] Sharpoor accepted the terms, either grateful for having been let off so easily or satisfied
[05:46 --> 05:51] that the Romans were admitting a justified defeat, and for a while the eastern front
[05:51 --> 05:55] went quiet.
[05:55 --> 05:59] Philip left his brother Gaius in Syria and granted all the authority a co-emperor might
[05:59 --> 06:00] expect.
[06:00 --> 06:05] Gaius then enjoyed a five-year run as the unquestioned ruler of the eastern empire while
[06:05 --> 06:09] his brother took over the west.
[06:09 --> 06:14] Philip was probably back in Rome at the end of 244 or the beginning of 245 and once he
[06:14 --> 06:20] arrived the Senate granted him the title Augustus and named his son Caesar, two declarations
[06:20 --> 06:25] I'm sure that came only after suitable promises from Philip that he meant them no harm and
[06:25 --> 06:31] suitable threats from the Praetorian Guard that maybe he did.
[06:31 --> 06:36] At roughly this same time the Senate asserted just a little bit of independence by pushing
[06:36 --> 06:41] through the deification of Gordian III over Philip's objections, objections that arose
[06:41 --> 06:49] most suspected from Philip's guilt over how he had murdered the boy.
[06:49 --> 06:53] Philip's short reign would prove to be a microcosm of the wider crisis period within which it
[06:53 --> 06:55] was set.
[06:55 --> 07:00] His years in power were defined by internal rebellion and external invasion and were it
[07:00 --> 07:05] not for the fact that he oversaw Rome's 1000th birthday celebration, which we'll get to
[07:05 --> 07:13] in a moment, his imperial career would like any sort of truly memorable moment at all.
[07:13 --> 07:18] This does, however, afford us a nice opportunity to turn our attention to one of those external
[07:18 --> 07:24] menaces that would help make the crisis of the third century the truly existential emergency
[07:24 --> 07:25] that it was.
[07:25 --> 07:31] I am speaking, of course, of the Goths.
[07:31 --> 07:36] There's a lot of confusion out there about who exactly the Goths were, when they appeared,
[07:36 --> 07:42] how they appeared, and who or what a Goth actually was, so I think it would be a good
[07:42 --> 07:47] idea to try to pick apart a few of the theories about their origins so we can have as clear
[07:47 --> 07:53] an understanding about this great northern menace to the Empire as we possibly can.
[07:53 --> 07:59] In time, the Goths would split into two main branches, the Visigoths and the Ostrogoths,
[07:59 --> 08:04] the former being the ones who first sacked Rome in 410 AD, the latter being the ones
[08:04 --> 08:09] who set up a successor kingdom in Italy following the fall of the Western Empire.
[08:09 --> 08:16] But right now, they were still more or less a single unified people.
[08:16 --> 08:22] The Goths first show up in the Roman record around 238 AD, just as the Empire was dealing
[08:22 --> 08:25] with its year of the six emperors.
[08:25 --> 08:30] While the Romans were occupied with their civil war, this new barbarian horde scorched
[08:30 --> 08:35] down from the Ukraine right past the Danube and sacked the city of Hystria, which was
[08:35 --> 08:38] situated on the banks of the Black Sea.
[08:38 --> 08:43] The size and the force of this invasion was so shocking that the provincial legions barely
[08:43 --> 08:48] had time to react before the Goths had come and gone.
[08:48 --> 08:53] For years, the assumption had been, occasional raids aside, that the tribes beyond the Danube
[08:53 --> 08:58] were no match for the legions, and so, focused on the domestic situation, the Roman soldiers
[08:58 --> 09:04] were simply not prepared to deal with the kind of aggressive threat the Goths posed.
[09:04 --> 09:08] But now, they were all on notice.
[09:08 --> 09:13] There are two main competing theories about where the Goths came from.
[09:13 --> 09:18] The first states that they originated in Sweden, were pushed across the Baltic by a shifting
[09:18 --> 09:25] climate sometime between 400 BC and 180, and then slowly migrated south until, by the 200s
[09:25 --> 09:30] AD, they were firmly situated in the modern Ukraine.
[09:30 --> 09:34] The other theory is that the Goths actually originated in the Ukraine, and that, like
[09:34 --> 09:40] the Franks, became a military powerhouse when local tribes combined into a super confederation,
[09:40 --> 09:46] whose wide banner eventually supplanted their old tribal identities.
[09:46 --> 09:51] Wherever they actually came from, by 238 AD, they were standing on Rome's doorstep, and
[09:51 --> 09:55] more than ready to come banging through the door.
[09:55 --> 10:00] There was a rumor going around, you see, that the Roman Empire was a paper tiger, that it
[10:00 --> 10:05] was rich beyond imagination, and protected only by a reputation they had stopped deserving
[10:05 --> 10:07] a long time ago.
[10:07 --> 10:12] In just a few years, the Goths would come to believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that
[10:12 --> 10:17] Rome was in fact theirs for the taking, when they utterly routed a Roman army, led personally
[10:17 --> 10:22] by the Emperor Decius, who would die in the fighting.
[10:22 --> 10:24] But that's for next week.
[10:24 --> 10:30] This week, we will simply note the opening forays of the Goths into Moesia and Dacia,
[10:30 --> 10:35] both of which dealt with persistent raids after the Goths discovered how easy it was
[10:35 --> 10:39] to march around the Roman border provinces.
[10:39 --> 10:42] Dacia especially stuck out like a sore thumb.
[10:42 --> 10:49] Not particularly well settled or well garrisoned, Dacia was an easy target for the Goths.
[10:49 --> 10:54] The Romans knew how difficult the province was to defend, going all the way back to Hadrian,
[10:54 --> 10:57] who tried to abandon it following Trajan's death.
[10:57 --> 11:02] But political pressure and the glorious memories of Trajan's campaign had kept the region
[11:02 --> 11:06] on the far side of the Danube within the empire.
[11:06 --> 11:09] But it would not survive the crisis of the third century.
[11:09 --> 11:14] In the midst of Aurelian's campaign to rebuild the shattered empire, Dacia would become a
[11:14 --> 11:16] strategic casualty.
[11:16 --> 11:22] By that point, 270 AD, everyone recognized that the province had become little more than
[11:22 --> 11:27] an unlocked back door into the empire, and its continued incorporation as a province
[11:27 --> 11:35] was far too dangerous to allow a little pride in past glories to get in the way.
[11:35 --> 11:40] While Philip kept one wary eye on the Goths, he had to keep another on the internal revolts
[11:40 --> 11:45] that kept springing up across the empire during his five years in office.
[11:45 --> 11:50] There are reports of at least four separate instances of provincials, citizens, or soldiers
[11:50 --> 11:53] attempting to overthrow Philip and Gaius.
[11:53 --> 12:00] In the east, Gaius especially provoked revolutionary ire with his heavy-handed governance.
[12:00 --> 12:05] Tax collection was harsh, and at least two of the revolts of the late 240s occurred in
[12:05 --> 12:08] the east and were directed at Gaius.
[12:08 --> 12:13] Some evidence even suggests that the last of these actually wound up claiming Gaius's
[12:13 --> 12:19] life, but as with Gordian III, the actual circumstances of Gaius Julius Priscus's death
[12:19 --> 12:23] remain unknown.
[12:23 --> 12:29] After four years of uneasy rule, everything finally came to a head in 248 AD.
[12:29 --> 12:34] That year, a simultaneously delivered both the high point of Philip's reign and the
[12:34 --> 12:39] beginning of the revolt that would eventually lead to his downfall.
[12:39 --> 12:45] The high point came in April, a month which the Romans had long circled on their calendars,
[12:45 --> 12:51] as it was believed to mark the one-thousandth anniversary of Romulus's founding of Rome.
[12:51 --> 12:56] The citizens of the capital expected a party, and Philip happily delivered a magnificent
[12:56 --> 13:02] set of secular games to celebrate.
[13:02 --> 13:07] To our modern ears, the name might seem to suggest that the secular games were a set
[13:07 --> 13:12] of games that had no religious overtones, but that's really just an ironic coincidence
[13:12 --> 13:17] of naming, as the secular games were, like everything the Romans did, a highly religious
[13:17 --> 13:19] affair.
[13:19 --> 13:25] The secular games get their name from the Roman concept of psychulum, which represented
[13:25 --> 13:29] the absolute upper bounds of a potential human life.
[13:29 --> 13:36] When a psychulum cycle ended, which the Romans calculated to last 100-110 years, the reasonable
[13:36 --> 13:42] belief was that there would have been a complete turnover in the living population in the meantime.
[13:42 --> 13:47] That is, whatever arbitrary day you pick to start the cycle, when you go 110 years in
[13:47 --> 13:51] the future, everyone who had been alive at the beginning, from the oldest man to the
[13:51 --> 13:54] youngest baby, would be dead.
[13:54 --> 14:00] The secular games thus held a particular fascination for the Romans, as they represented a set
[14:00 --> 14:06] of ceremonies and celebrations that, theoretically at least, no one had ever seen before or would
[14:06 --> 14:09] ever see again.
[14:09 --> 14:14] The origin myth of the games reached back into the misty days of the early kingdom when
[14:14 --> 14:20] a Sabine man, trying to save his sick children, was commanded to conduct nocturnal sacrifices
[14:20 --> 14:25] to the Celtic god Dispator and the Greek god Persephone, both of whom were strongly
[14:25 --> 14:29] associated with the underworld.
[14:29 --> 14:34] Over the course of three days, he conducted the necessary ceremonies on the campus marshes,
[14:34 --> 14:38] his children lived, and he was then left with instructions that the ceremony should be repeated
[14:38 --> 14:43] once per psychulum from that day forward.
[14:43 --> 14:47] How closely the Romans held to this injunction is unknown, but when the high priests of
[14:47 --> 14:53] Rome consulted the Sibylline books in 249 while the First Punic War was raging, they
[14:53 --> 14:59] were told that the prescription for what ailed them was to renew the secular sacrifices.
[14:59 --> 15:04] This set was dutifully followed up in the 140s AD, but then, when the cycle next came
[15:04 --> 15:10] round, Rome was too caught up in the fall of the Republic to remember.
[15:10 --> 15:14] After Augustus became emperor, though, he decided he wanted to throw games better than
[15:14 --> 15:19] anyone had ever seen before or would ever see again, and got the idea to revive the
[15:19 --> 15:22] secular games in 17 BC.
[15:22 --> 15:28] He revamped the ceremonies, instructed the priests to sacrifice to proper Roman gods,
[15:28 --> 15:33] and introduced daytime sacrifices to accompany the traditional nighttime ceremonies.
[15:33 --> 15:38] He also introduced the games, the banquets, and theatrical performances that came to be
[15:38 --> 15:42] most closely associated with the event.
[15:42 --> 15:47] Augustus was not reviving an ancient tradition just to mumble some words at midnight.
[15:47 --> 15:53] He wanted to throw the biggest party of anyone's lifetime.
[15:53 --> 15:57] After the secular games of Augustus, though, the theoretical underpinnings of the ceremony
[15:57 --> 16:03] took a hit when Claudius decided to throw his own set in 47 AD.
[16:03 --> 16:08] He had good reason to throw his games early, but Suetonius notes that Claudius was much
[16:08 --> 16:14] mocked for announcing festivities that none had seen before and none would see again when
[16:14 --> 16:19] plenty of people had been around when Augustus had said the same thing.
[16:19 --> 16:23] The good reason for Claudius' secular games, though, was to celebrate the revolution of
[16:23 --> 16:30] a different hundred year cycle, as 47 AD marked the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome,
[16:30 --> 16:35] and Claudius didn't want the birthday to pass unnoticed.
[16:35 --> 16:39] From that point on, there were two cycles of secular games, basically negating the whole
[16:39 --> 16:45] not before, not ever again mystique, but the various emperors were not going to let an
[16:45 --> 16:50] opportunity to associate their name with this most rare of ceremonies pass.
[16:50 --> 16:55] So one cycle followed Augustus and led to games thrown by Domitian in 88 and Septimius
[16:55 --> 17:01] Severus in 204, and another cycle following Claudius and the birthdays of Rome, which
[17:01 --> 17:07] led to games thrown in 148 by Antoninus Pius, and this last set thrown by Philip the Arab
[17:07 --> 17:10] in 248.
[17:10 --> 17:15] The next time either cycle came around, though, the empire was already undergoing Constantine's
[17:15 --> 17:20] push to Christianize, and like a dozen other pagan celebrations, the secular games were
[17:20 --> 17:22] neglected.
[17:22 --> 17:27] So when Philip announced his games and said that no one would ever see their like again,
[17:27 --> 17:32] he at least was telling the truth.
[17:32 --> 17:37] Philip's games included the usual sacrifices, accompanied by city-wide theatrical performances
[17:37 --> 17:42] and gladiatorial contests that saw a thousand men and god knows how many thousands of exotic
[17:42 --> 17:47] animals killing and being killed for the crowd's amusement.
[17:47 --> 17:52] When it was all over, everyone agreed that the event had lived up to its billing.
[17:52 --> 17:56] No one had ever seen anything like it before, and they could expect to never see anything
[17:56 --> 17:58] like it again.
[17:58 --> 18:02] Philip was the toast of Rome.
[18:02 --> 18:07] But Philip was not the toast of the province of Moesia.
[18:07 --> 18:11] The troops along the lower Danube had dealt with the brunt of the initial Gothic invasions,
[18:11 --> 18:17] and so far they had not had much success against this new barbarian menace.
[18:17 --> 18:21] It appears that in response, the regular soldiers of the legions were clamoring to take the
[18:21 --> 18:26] fight across the Danube and into the territory of the Goths.
[18:26 --> 18:31] The invasion would offer the men a chance to exact some revenge for their lost honor,
[18:31 --> 18:36] but perhaps more importantly, it would give them a chance to plunder a heretofore unknown
[18:36 --> 18:38] source of wealth.
[18:38 --> 18:44] The empire hadn't really had a good sizable influx of slaves since the Marcomannic Wars,
[18:44 --> 18:48] and the thought of selling off a hundred thousand Goths into slavery was a mighty big incentive
[18:48 --> 18:51] to fight another big war in the north.
[18:51 --> 18:56] But Philip was content for now to keep the legions in their camps.
[18:56 --> 19:01] A northern war might sound good when it's pitched by grunts and to grunts, but up in
[19:01 --> 19:05] the high command, they understood that the likelihood of success was low, and the likelihood
[19:05 --> 19:10] of doing irreparable damage to the northern defenses was high.
[19:10 --> 19:15] But that didn't stop the grunts from talking, and in time, it didn't stop them from revolting
[19:15 --> 19:19] against their cowardly leadership.
[19:19 --> 19:25] In mid-248, while Philip was back in Rome celebrating the capital's birthday, the
[19:25 --> 19:31] legions stationed in Moesia rebelled and declared a man named Tiberius Claudius Marinus Peccatianus
[19:31 --> 19:33] their new emperor.
[19:33 --> 19:38] There had been revolts before, but this one seemed particularly serious as it involved
[19:38 --> 19:41] the legions of such a critical region.
[19:41 --> 19:46] As Philip and his advisors scrambled to come up with a response plan, though, a man took
[19:46 --> 19:51] to the floor of the Senate and declared that there was nothing to fear.
[19:51 --> 19:55] The troops in Moesia, he announced, would quickly come to regret their hasty rebellion
[19:55 --> 20:00] and would probably kill their new leader in just a matter of days.
[20:00 --> 20:04] With Philip thinking he might have to go so far as to resign his office just to restore
[20:04 --> 20:10] peace, he was naturally intrigued by the certainty of the old senator's prediction, and thought
[20:10 --> 20:16] the man a genius when, just a few days later, word came that the rebellion had in fact collapsed
[20:16 --> 20:19] and Peccatianus was dead.
[20:19 --> 20:25] This was how Gaius Macias Quintus Theseus earned the everlasting love and respect of
[20:25 --> 20:29] Philip the Arab.
[20:29 --> 20:34] Theseus had been born in 201 in lower Pannonia and had spent his entire life serving the
[20:34 --> 20:37] empire as a distinguished senator.
[20:37 --> 20:44] He had been consul in 232 and had served as governor of lower Germany, Moesia, and Hispania
[20:44 --> 20:45] Terraconensis.
[20:45 --> 20:50] All key provinces with significant troop deployments.
[20:50 --> 20:56] It appears that he was in Spain during the tumultuous year of 238, but had he not been,
[20:56 --> 20:59] it seems highly likely that he would have been elected one of the twenty senators of
[20:59 --> 21:02] the emergency council.
[21:02 --> 21:08] During the early years of Philip's reign, Theseus had been prefect of Rome, and by 248,
[21:08 --> 21:13] there was really no one in the Senate, with the possible exception of Valerian, more accomplished
[21:13 --> 21:15] and respected than Theseus.
[21:15 --> 21:23] His bold and correct reading of the situation in Moesia only increased that standing.
[21:23 --> 21:27] But just because the rebellion had collapsed, that did not mean that Philip and his regime
[21:27 --> 21:29] were out of danger.
[21:29 --> 21:33] The troops may have lost their nerve this time, but that did not mean that they had
[21:33 --> 21:35] lost their nerve forever.
[21:35 --> 21:41] Clearly, a firm hand was needed along the Danube to restore discipline and make sure
[21:41 --> 21:44] like this didn't happen in the future.
[21:44 --> 21:49] And who better to send on this mission than wise Theseus, who seemed to know the troops
[21:49 --> 21:52] better than they knew themselves.
[21:52 --> 21:57] So Philip ordered Theseus to Moesia, where he was to whip the legions back into shape
[21:57 --> 22:02] and prepare them for the critical task of defending the empire from a gothic threat
[22:02 --> 22:07] that looked only to be gaining strength with each passing year.
[22:07 --> 22:13] When looked at one way, that Theseus was respected, capable, loyal and smart, the decision
[22:13 --> 22:16] to send him to Moesia was an obvious one.
[22:16 --> 22:21] But when looked at another way, taking into account that Theseus was easily more popular
[22:21 --> 22:25] than Philip, and was about to be given command over the largest and best fighting force in
[22:25 --> 22:32] the empire, the decision to send him to Moesia turns into an absurd blunder.
[22:32 --> 22:36] In any event, the next time the two would face each other would be at the heads of opposing
[22:36 --> 22:37] armies.
[22:37 --> 22:42] So yeah, maybe Philip shouldn't have gone and done that.
[22:42 --> 22:44] But that is for next week.
[22:44 --> 22:49] I want to close this week by addressing one little piece of historical trivia that was
[22:49 --> 22:53] believed for centuries, but has since been more or less abandoned.
[22:53 --> 23:00] The fact that Philip the Arab may have been the first Christian emperor of Rome.
[23:00 --> 23:05] This rumor mostly took root as a result of Vesubius describing an incident in his ecclesiastical
[23:05 --> 23:11] history that has Philip attempting to visit a church shortly after becoming emperor,
[23:11 --> 23:17] being denied entry by the bishop, and then confessing his sins to gain admittance.
[23:17 --> 23:22] His subsequent toleration of Christianity, in contrast most especially to his successor
[23:22 --> 23:27] Theseus, served as further circumstantial proof that Philip was in fact a member of
[23:27 --> 23:29] the flock.
[23:29 --> 23:34] But weighing the scales down on the other side are big known facts, like Philip's
[23:34 --> 23:39] embrace of his role as Pontifex maximus, and the pagan ceremonies he officiated during
[23:39 --> 23:46] the secular games, both of which would have been big no-nos had he been truly Christian.
[23:46 --> 23:51] With regards to Philip's relationship with the church, I am content then to believe that
[23:51 --> 23:55] given his upbringing in the Christianized East, that he probably had more sympathy to
[23:55 --> 24:01] and connection with the Christian communities than most of his imperial colleagues.
[24:01 --> 24:05] But it doesn't seem plausible that he himself was a Christian.
[24:05 --> 24:12] Philip's positive relationship with Christianity, though, does offer an interesting insight
[24:12 --> 24:17] into the subsequent persecutions of Theseus, who would wind up issuing an edict shortly
[24:17 --> 24:23] after he became emperor, demanding citizens of Rome offer sacrifices to the pagan gods.
[24:23 --> 24:28] Theseus may have issued his edict to get the troubled Roman Empire back on the right side
[24:28 --> 24:34] of the gods, but he may also have issued it as a means of persecuting allies of Philip
[24:34 --> 24:40] as Theseus looked to consolidate his own rule.
[24:40 --> 24:45] Next week, we will explore the anti-Christian policies of Theseus, but only after we cover
[24:45 --> 24:49] his accidental rebellion against Philip.
[24:49 --> 24:53] It seems that good Theseus had every intention of restoring discipline to the troops along
[24:53 --> 24:59] the Danube, but upon arriving was greeted with an ultimatum that he either lead them
[24:59 --> 25:03] in a new revolt or die right there on the spot.
[25:03 --> 25:09] Loyal to Philip, but not suicidally loyal to Philip, Theseus agreed to their demands
[25:09 --> 25:15] and immediately about-faced and headed back to Italy, this time at the head of an army.

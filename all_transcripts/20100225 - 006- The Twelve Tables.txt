[00:03 --> 00:06] Hello, and welcome to the History of Rome.
[00:08 --> 00:13] We ended last week with the plebes finally being granted nominal political rights, or
[00:13 --> 00:17] at least defenders within the political arena, with the creation of the Office of Tribune.
[00:18 --> 00:22] This stopped plebian agitation for a while, but as the years passed a new generation
[00:22 --> 00:27] came of age and demanded further protection from the ever present threat of patrician
[00:27 --> 00:28] tyranny.
[00:28 --> 00:33] It was not enough to be protected from an abuse of the law, because, at the time, nobody
[00:33 --> 00:34] knew exactly what the law was.
[00:35 --> 00:40] The legal framework of Rome was a nebulous body of oral and written traditions, with
[00:40 --> 00:45] precedents and sub-causes hiding all over the place, in official decrees, letters,
[00:45 --> 00:49] pronouncements, and, most dangerously, in the minds of old patrician lawyers.
[00:50 --> 00:54] Who was to say a man was being treated unjustly if no one knew exactly what
[00:54 --> 00:55] justice was?
[00:56 --> 01:00] This new generation of plebian agitators would ultimately win a great victory for
[01:00 --> 01:04] themselves and the rule of law, giving the Romans a set of written precepts that would
[01:04 --> 01:08] be memorized by every child and recited by every adult.
[01:08 --> 01:10] The Twelve Tables of Roman Law.
[01:11 --> 01:16] This official codification of the law occurred around 451 BC, but before we
[01:16 --> 01:20] get to that point in our story, I want to give a brief account of what Rome
[01:20 --> 01:24] dealt with in the forty odd years between the inception of the tribune and the
[01:24 --> 01:25] creation of the Twelve Tables.
[01:26 --> 01:31] Internally, Rome was full of tension, but, as I said, for the first twenty years or
[01:31 --> 01:35] so, nothing boiled over too much to disrupt the day-to-day, year-to-year
[01:35 --> 01:36] operations of the city.
[01:37 --> 01:40] The consuls and senate still held the lion's share of the power, though they
[01:40 --> 01:42] were now checked somewhat by the tribunes.
[01:43 --> 01:47] The Romans were held together by an unceasing series of wars against their neighbors
[01:47 --> 01:49] to the north, east, and south.
[01:49 --> 01:53] To the north, they fought a particularly hard campaign against their old
[01:53 --> 01:58] nemesis, the Vaeites, that ended in a stalemate in 474 BC, a campaign that came
[01:58 --> 02:02] complete with a dressed up battle of Thermopylae, with 306 members of the
[02:02 --> 02:07] noble Phaebi family cast in the role of King Leonidas and his doomed Spartans.
[02:07 --> 02:11] Protecting an undefensible past, the Phaebi clan fought to the last man to
[02:11 --> 02:13] give the legions a chance to regroup.
[02:14 --> 02:17] The battles fought to the east and south were of a different sort and
[02:17 --> 02:20] revolved around a geographically based cultural clash.
[02:20 --> 02:24] Vaea may have been in competition with Rome, but at least it was a settled city
[02:24 --> 02:25] of civilized farmers.
[02:26 --> 02:31] Out in the eastern hills, however, nomadic tribes, particularly the Volscians
[02:31 --> 02:33] and the Aquians, pressed at Rome's borders.
[02:34 --> 02:38] The nomadic herdsmen coveted Rome's soft, flat land and tried every year to
[02:38 --> 02:42] carve out some or all of Roman territory and turn it from parceled
[02:42 --> 02:44] farms into a massive grazing zone.
[02:44 --> 02:48] As a result, the Romans were constantly beating back encroachment by the
[02:48 --> 02:51] migrant tribes, who occasionally mustered enough force to give the Romans
[02:51 --> 02:54] a run for their money, but were usually dispatched easily.
[02:55 --> 02:58] For the first 10 years after the secession of the Plebes and running
[02:58 --> 03:02] concurrently with the onagan-offagan battles with Vaea, the Volscians
[03:02 --> 03:03] posed the greatest danger.
[03:04 --> 03:07] They had already made great inroads south of the city, effectively
[03:07 --> 03:10] securing all the land between the hills and the sea, blocking trade
[03:10 --> 03:11] with Magna Graecia.
[03:12 --> 03:16] The peak of the Volscian threat came early, in 491 BC, when a
[03:16 --> 03:20] disgruntled Roman general named Corleones defected and led a Volscian
[03:20 --> 03:23] army through the legions and right to the gates of the city.
[03:23 --> 03:27] The Roman men beaten, the women were sent to plead with Corleones to
[03:27 --> 03:30] end his attack, and it was only after a personal appeal from his
[03:30 --> 03:34] own mother that Corleones' heart finally turned and he withdrew the army.
[03:35 --> 03:38] His Volscian officers were appalled at being denied their easy victory,
[03:38 --> 03:41] and back in Volscian territory, they murdered their Roman leader.
[03:42 --> 03:45] It has been noted that the story of Corleones bears a striking
[03:45 --> 03:48] resemblance to the story of the great Athenian general Themistocles,
[03:48 --> 03:51] and that the story was probably inserted later to account for the
[03:51 --> 03:54] defeat suffered by Rome at the hands of nomadic rabble.
[03:54 --> 03:58] The Roman ego demanded that Romans could only be defeated by other
[03:58 --> 03:58] Romans.
[03:59 --> 04:02] By the mid-480s BC, though, the Volscian threat had largely
[04:02 --> 04:05] been contained and the city was never seriously threatened again,
[04:05 --> 04:08] though the Volscians maintained control over the southern plains
[04:08 --> 04:11] for the remainder of the century and were a constant menace along
[04:11 --> 04:12] Rome's borders.
[04:12 --> 04:17] Throughout the 470s and 460s BC, even though the external danger
[04:17 --> 04:20] had been greatly diminished, the legions still went out every
[04:20 --> 04:23] summer campaigning against the latest forays by the Volscians
[04:23 --> 04:24] or Achaean raiders.
[04:24 --> 04:27] The total military dominance of Rome over the Hill tribes
[04:27 --> 04:30] eventually led the plebe leaders to suspect that the patricians
[04:30 --> 04:33] were not being totally honest with the threat level posed by
[04:33 --> 04:37] the tribes, and with the record the Roman army had, it's hard
[04:37 --> 04:37] to blame them.
[04:38 --> 04:41] Without even breaking a sweat, the legions dispatched every
[04:41 --> 04:42] enemy they encountered.
[04:43 --> 04:45] A political pattern began to emerge.
[04:45 --> 04:49] Plebe leaders would decry the raising of yet another army to
[04:49 --> 04:51] go to battle with the Volscians or whoever, even though
[04:51 --> 04:54] they posed no serious threat, and would denounce the
[04:54 --> 04:57] Senate for starting wars to put off questions of further
[04:57 --> 04:59] economic and political reform.
[04:59 --> 05:03] These leaders would always, in turn, be denounced by the
[05:03 --> 05:05] Senate as self-absorbed traitors who were putting
[05:05 --> 05:07] personal ambition ahead of Rome's safety.
[05:08 --> 05:10] The plebe leaders would shoot back that the patricians were
[05:10 --> 05:13] sending men out to die for no other reason than to tighten
[05:13 --> 05:15] their grip on wealth and power.
[05:15 --> 05:19] A standoff would ensue, but Rome, being what it was, would
[05:19 --> 05:22] ultimately raise the legion, and the plebeian demagogues
[05:22 --> 05:23] would be silenced.
[05:23 --> 05:26] The Romans were soldiers, and fighting is what they did.
[05:27 --> 05:29] Throughout these years, Rome's position vis-a-vis the
[05:29 --> 05:31] nomadic herdsmen was never seriously threatened,
[05:32 --> 05:34] though in the following century, Rome would fight a
[05:34 --> 05:37] knock-down, drag-out war with a rising Hill tribe
[05:37 --> 05:40] called the Samnites that would ultimately see all Italy
[05:40 --> 05:42] eventually fighting on one side or the other.
[05:44 --> 05:46] In the years after the secession of the plebes, there
[05:46 --> 05:49] were essentially two major initiatives that excited the
[05:49 --> 05:51] plebes and kept the patricians up at night.
[05:51 --> 05:53] The first was proposed by a tribune named
[05:53 --> 05:55] Valero in 473 BC.
[05:56 --> 05:58] It stated simply that the tribunes ought to be elected
[05:58 --> 06:01] by the tribal assembly and not by the communist
[06:01 --> 06:03] centuriata as they had been in the first years after
[06:03 --> 06:04] the office was created.
[06:05 --> 06:08] The patricians balked at the idea, knowing full well
[06:08 --> 06:10] that they would no longer have undue weight in
[06:10 --> 06:11] choosing who would be tribune.
[06:12 --> 06:15] As I noted last week, the patricians inevitably failed
[06:15 --> 06:16] in their attempt to quash the proposal.
[06:17 --> 06:19] An election of the tribunes was duly passed to the
[06:19 --> 06:20] Commida Tributa.
[06:21 --> 06:25] As if this wasn't bad enough, in 462 BC, a
[06:25 --> 06:27] tribune named Tarantellus made an even
[06:27 --> 06:28] more radical proposal.
[06:29 --> 06:32] The laws of Rome should be written down and posted so
[06:32 --> 06:35] that all citizens would be bound to the same codes,
[06:35 --> 06:37] and no man could rise above them.
[06:37 --> 06:40] The patricians were horrified at the thought and
[06:40 --> 06:42] spent the next 10 years doing everything in their
[06:42 --> 06:44] power to stop its implementation.
[06:44 --> 06:47] It was during these years that the plebes really
[06:47 --> 06:49] started to resist military service and openly
[06:49 --> 06:51] questioned patrician motives.
[06:52 --> 06:54] At one point, however, caught up in their own
[06:54 --> 06:56] rhetoric, they failed to believe it when the
[06:56 --> 06:57] Senate woke up one morning and announced that
[06:57 --> 07:00] during the night, a small Sabine army had
[07:00 --> 07:02] penetrated the city and had taken the citadel.
[07:03 --> 07:05] It was only after a desperate plea by the
[07:05 --> 07:07] consuls that the plebes finally agreed to raise
[07:07 --> 07:10] an army, finding much to their surprise that the
[07:10 --> 07:12] citadel had in fact been taken and their city
[07:12 --> 07:12] was under siege.
[07:13 --> 07:16] The legions, along with a contingent of local
[07:16 --> 07:18] allies, easily dislodged the Sabines and the
[07:18 --> 07:21] greatest casualty of the whole encounter was
[07:21 --> 07:23] what little influence the tribunes had so
[07:23 --> 07:24] recently achieved.
[07:24 --> 07:27] The patricians, as a result, managed to put off
[07:27 --> 07:30] Tarantellus' proposal for another 10 years.
[07:31 --> 07:33] In the end, though, they were forced to relent.
[07:33 --> 07:35] Political consciousness had been raised in the
[07:35 --> 07:38] city by travelers from the south who brought
[07:38 --> 07:40] with them word of Solon's political reforms in
[07:40 --> 07:42] the great Greek city of Athens, causing
[07:42 --> 07:44] proponents of reform to beat a steady drum.
[07:45 --> 07:48] Finally, a combination of plague, famine, and
[07:48 --> 07:50] the economically destabilizing introduction
[07:50 --> 07:54] of coins as a medium of exchange in 454 BC
[07:54 --> 07:56] led to a crisis of confidence in the
[07:56 --> 07:58] leadership and something had to be done to
[07:58 --> 07:59] assuage the masses.
[08:00 --> 08:03] It was agreed in 451 BC that consular power
[08:03 --> 08:05] for the year would be transferred to a body
[08:05 --> 08:08] of 10 men called the decemvirate, whose main
[08:08 --> 08:10] task it would be to collect and condense
[08:10 --> 08:12] Roman law into a single uniform code to be
[08:12 --> 08:14] published on bronze tablets in the form
[08:14 --> 08:15] for all to see.
[08:16 --> 08:18] Unfortunately, the total contents of the
[08:18 --> 08:21] 12 tables, each posted on a separate bronze
[08:21 --> 08:24] tablet, hence the name, have been lost to
[08:24 --> 08:26] history and all we have to rely on is
[08:26 --> 08:29] occasional excerpts and summaries by later
[08:29 --> 08:29] Roman authors.
[08:30 --> 08:32] We know generally what topics each table
[08:32 --> 08:35] covered and the range in detail gives a
[08:35 --> 08:37] fascinating insight into the Roman mind.
[08:38 --> 08:41] Held within the tables written 2500 years ago,
[08:41 --> 08:43] we find the basis for many of our own
[08:43 --> 08:44] founding principles.
[08:44 --> 08:47] For example, the ninth table explicitly forbids
[08:47 --> 08:49] passage of laws against specific individuals,
[08:50 --> 08:52] a principle still enforced today, while the
[08:52 --> 08:54] first table establishes the sanctity of the
[08:54 --> 08:56] subpoena or the requirement to appear
[08:56 --> 08:57] before a court.
[08:58 --> 09:00] The tables covered a wide range of matters,
[09:00 --> 09:03] from lawsuit procedures to payment of debts,
[09:04 --> 09:06] to inheritance rights, to upkeep of public
[09:06 --> 09:09] sewers, to divorce and property boundary issues.
[09:09 --> 09:11] I will not bore you with a lengthy recitation
[09:11 --> 09:14] of the contents of each table, but I do want
[09:14 --> 09:16] to highlight some of the more curious facets
[09:16 --> 09:17] of the Roman legal mind.
[09:18 --> 09:20] For example, according to the eighth table,
[09:20 --> 09:22] a thief caught at night may be killed
[09:22 --> 09:24] without penalty, but if the same thief is
[09:24 --> 09:26] caught during the day, he must be delivered
[09:26 --> 09:27] unharmed to the magistrates.
[09:28 --> 09:30] Contained within the same table, we
[09:30 --> 09:32] discover what the penalty was for throwing
[09:32 --> 09:34] an un-aimed weapon into a crowd.
[09:34 --> 09:36] The accused was fined one ram.
[09:37 --> 09:38] The seventh table states that fruit that
[09:38 --> 09:40] falls from a tree onto a neighbor's property
[09:40 --> 09:42] shall be the property of that neighbor,
[09:42 --> 09:45] a provision which demonstrates just how
[09:45 --> 09:47] scrupulously litigious the Romans could be.
[09:48 --> 09:50] Death was the ultimate penalty and was
[09:50 --> 09:51] prescribed for a number of crimes,
[09:51 --> 09:53] including murder and the destruction of crops,
[09:54 --> 09:56] but also, interestingly, for matters involving
[09:56 --> 09:57] the integrity of the courts.
[09:58 --> 10:00] Magistrates who took bribes to influence
[10:00 --> 10:02] their decisions, as well as witnesses
[10:02 --> 10:04] who lied under oath, were both ordered
[10:04 --> 10:05] flung from a high cliff.
[10:06 --> 10:09] To the Romans, perjury was a heinous crime
[10:09 --> 10:10] that threatened the entire community.
[10:11 --> 10:13] The final provision I want to point out
[10:13 --> 10:15] was hidden deep in the ninth table,
[10:15 --> 10:17] a piece of fine print that, once discovered,
[10:18 --> 10:19] outraged the plebes and led
[10:19 --> 10:21] to violent class confrontations.
[10:22 --> 10:25] No patrician shall be allowed to marry a plebe.
[10:26 --> 10:28] Effectively, this codified a closing off
[10:28 --> 10:30] of upward social mobility to the majority
[10:30 --> 10:32] of the population and guaranteed that none
[10:32 --> 10:34] of them would ever hold the most powerful
[10:34 --> 10:36] office of state, the consulship.
[10:36 --> 10:39] This did not go over well with the plebes.
[10:40 --> 10:42] As I mentioned earlier, the 12 tables
[10:42 --> 10:44] were the foundation of later Roman law
[10:44 --> 10:45] and were memorized by all citizens,
[10:46 --> 10:46] literate or not.
[10:47 --> 10:49] The existence of a written body of law
[10:49 --> 10:50] was not a Roman innovation,
[10:51 --> 10:53] nor did it make them unique in the ancient world,
[10:53 --> 10:56] but it did put them into a select group of states
[10:56 --> 10:58] that valued the objectivity of the law
[10:58 --> 11:00] over the subjectivity of capricious rulers.
[11:02 --> 11:03] The story of the decemvirs,
[11:03 --> 11:05] the magistrates tasked with the compilation,
[11:06 --> 11:08] ends with an interesting bit of legendary melodrama.
[11:09 --> 11:12] During the year, or two depending on the source,
[11:12 --> 11:13] that the decemvirs were in office,
[11:14 --> 11:15] they held ultimate authority.
[11:15 --> 11:17] The unbroken chain of consular elections
[11:17 --> 11:20] had been broken and effectively a new form
[11:20 --> 11:22] of government had been briefly ushered in.
[11:23 --> 11:26] Rather than rule by two men, it was rule by 10 men,
[11:26 --> 11:30] and among those 10 men, one was first among equals,
[11:30 --> 11:32] a man named Apius Claudius.
[11:33 --> 11:35] Claudius came from a family of staunch patricians
[11:35 --> 11:36] and was a vigorous opponent
[11:36 --> 11:39] of just about any proposed plebeian reform.
[11:40 --> 11:41] After finishing their appointed task,
[11:42 --> 11:44] the decemvirate had lost their raison d'etre
[11:44 --> 11:45] and was set to disband,
[11:46 --> 11:48] but Claudius, enjoying his newfound power,
[11:48 --> 11:50] convinced his colleagues that they should remain in office
[11:50 --> 11:52] after their term expired.
[11:53 --> 11:55] The other decemvirs, similarly enjoying
[11:55 --> 11:57] the trappings of power, agreed,
[11:57 --> 11:59] and when the consular elections for that year arrived,
[12:00 --> 12:02] the decemvirate simply did not allow anyone to stand
[12:02 --> 12:03] and no elections were held.
[12:04 --> 12:06] The people found themselves unexpectedly
[12:06 --> 12:08] in a constitutional crisis.
[12:08 --> 12:10] Even though Claudius and the decemvirs
[12:10 --> 12:11] had made a naked power grab,
[12:12 --> 12:14] there was no legal avenue available to stop them,
[12:14 --> 12:16] for the decemvirate had been instilled
[12:16 --> 12:17] with all judicial authority.
[12:18 --> 12:21] Ironically, the body of men who laid down the laws
[12:21 --> 12:23] were the first to blatantly ignore them.
[12:24 --> 12:26] Days and weeks passed with the decemvirate
[12:26 --> 12:28] maintaining their illegal hold on power
[12:28 --> 12:30] until finally Claudius went too far
[12:30 --> 12:32] and the entire city rose up in revolt.
[12:33 --> 12:36] Claudius had his eye on a beautiful plebeian girl
[12:36 --> 12:38] who was said to be married to a young army officer.
[12:39 --> 12:41] Claudius declared out of the blue
[12:41 --> 12:43] that the girl in question was an escaped slave
[12:43 --> 12:44] owned by one of his clients
[12:44 --> 12:46] and that she must be returned.
[12:46 --> 12:49] A hearing was called to decide the case
[12:49 --> 12:51] and numerous witnesses were brought up
[12:51 --> 12:53] attesting to the freeborn status of the young woman.
[12:54 --> 12:56] But the trial was overseen by Claudius who,
[12:56 --> 12:58] to the astonishment of everyone present,
[12:59 --> 13:01] ruled that the girl was indeed an escaped slave
[13:01 --> 13:03] and was the property of the complaining client
[13:03 --> 13:05] despite obvious evidence to the contrary.
[13:06 --> 13:09] The people were appalled at this absurd conclusion
[13:09 --> 13:11] and the army, when it caught wind of the decision,
[13:11 --> 13:12] joined in their outrage.
[13:13 --> 13:15] The husband-to-be and the father of the woman
[13:15 --> 13:17] were both officers in good standing
[13:17 --> 13:20] and the army was incredulous at the arbitrary injustice
[13:20 --> 13:22] of Claudius towards one of their own.
[13:23 --> 13:25] The people, supported by the army,
[13:25 --> 13:27] then used their bargaining chip of last resort
[13:27 --> 13:29] and abandoned the city,
[13:29 --> 13:31] removing themselves to the sacred mount
[13:31 --> 13:33] just as they had done four years earlier.
[13:33 --> 13:36] The Decembers recognized that their position
[13:36 --> 13:38] had become untenable, finally resigned.
[13:39 --> 13:40] Claudius was arrested,
[13:40 --> 13:42] but rather than face trial, he killed himself.
[13:43 --> 13:46] Regular consular elections then took place
[13:46 --> 13:49] and Rome's domestic tranquility was restored.
[13:49 --> 13:51] The plebeians actually emerged from the order
[13:51 --> 13:53] better off than they had been.
[13:53 --> 13:55] For in their negotiations to return to the city,
[13:56 --> 13:58] they demanded the number of tribunes be raised to 10,
[13:58 --> 13:59] which the Senate,
[13:59 --> 14:01] anxious to get things back to normal
[14:01 --> 14:03] and again fearing invasion, agreed to.
[14:04 --> 14:06] And of course, the codification of the laws,
[14:07 --> 14:08] the decades-long plebeian demand,
[14:08 --> 14:10] had already been accomplished,
[14:10 --> 14:12] leaving them in a much stronger position legally
[14:12 --> 14:14] to fend off future patrician tyranny.
[14:15 --> 14:18] The creation of the 12 tables left the plebes
[14:18 --> 14:20] on the one hand overjoyed,
[14:20 --> 14:22] but on the other they were horrified
[14:22 --> 14:23] by some of the provisions it contained.
[14:24 --> 14:26] True, the rule of law would now dominate
[14:26 --> 14:28] patrician subjectivity,
[14:28 --> 14:30] but that one sticking point of the illegality
[14:30 --> 14:32] of patrician-plebe marriage
[14:32 --> 14:34] opened their eyes to an oppression
[14:34 --> 14:35] that they never knew existed.
[14:36 --> 14:38] Only patricians could be consuls
[14:38 --> 14:39] or hold the other high magistrates,
[14:40 --> 14:41] including Pontifex Maximus,
[14:41 --> 14:44] if no plebe could ever marry a patrician,
[14:44 --> 14:46] then no plebe would ever hold high office
[14:46 --> 14:48] and the patricians would always and forever
[14:48 --> 14:50] hold the winning political hand.
[14:51 --> 14:53] The next cycle of patrician-plebe conflict
[14:53 --> 14:55] would revolve around this very issue,
[14:55 --> 14:57] eventually leading to a number of reforms
[14:57 --> 15:00] that further diluted the patrician stranglehold
[15:00 --> 15:02] on power, which we will get to in the weeks ahead.
[15:04 --> 15:05] Those of you who know Roman history
[15:05 --> 15:07] may have noticed that I ran right by
[15:07 --> 15:09] one of the most well-known folk legends,
[15:09 --> 15:11] which occurred around 460 BC,
[15:11 --> 15:13] without so much as a mention.
[15:14 --> 15:16] That is because next week I want to focus in detail
[15:16 --> 15:17] on the central figure of that story,
[15:18 --> 15:19] the great Cincinnati's,
[15:19 --> 15:21] whose career spans both sides
[15:21 --> 15:23] of the December interlude.
[15:23 --> 15:26] Join me next week as we untangle the man from the myth
[15:26 --> 15:27] and figure out what made Cincinnati
[15:27 --> 15:29] such a towering figure
[15:29 --> 15:31] that American settlers felt compelled
[15:31 --> 15:33] to name their new boom town on the Ohio River
[15:33 --> 15:36] after a Roman who had been dead 2,200 years.

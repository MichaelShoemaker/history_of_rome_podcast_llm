[00:40 --> 00:43] This week, I am going to recommend a book that has been hanging around on the bestseller
[00:43 --> 00:50] list for a while now and was recommended by listener Casey, The Big Short by Michael Lewis,
[00:50 --> 00:56] which tells the story of the incomprehensible and ultimately insanely destructive world
[00:56 --> 00:58] of mortgage-backed securities.
[00:58 --> 01:03] I know Lewis just from Moneyball and so can attest only to the fact that his writing is
[01:03 --> 01:08] excellent and that Joe Morgan will probably not read this book either before dismissing
[01:08 --> 01:10] it completely.
[01:10 --> 01:16] Just remember to go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash Rome so that they know who sent you.
[01:21 --> 01:25] Hello and welcome to The History of Rome.
[01:25 --> 01:32] Episode 131, The New Game in Town.
[01:32 --> 01:36] Last time, we left off with the Tetrarchy in general disarray.
[01:36 --> 01:42] Maxentius had revolted, Severus was dead at the hands of Maximian, Galerius had been forced
[01:42 --> 01:50] to slink out of Italy, and up in the north, Constantine was just sort of lurking ominously.
[01:50 --> 01:54] The only members of the Imperial Brotherhood who remained untouched by the events of the
[01:54 --> 01:59] last two years were the retired Diocletian, who is about to get dragged back into all
[01:59 --> 02:08] this, and the eastern Caesar, Maximinus Dio, who is himself about to become quite disgruntled.
[02:08 --> 02:13] At this point, it might not have been clear to all the players that the game had changed,
[02:13 --> 02:19] but they were about to learn pretty quick that the Tetrarchy was no longer an end unto
[02:19 --> 02:20] itself.
[02:20 --> 02:24] It was now simply a means to an end.
[02:24 --> 02:28] In other words, getting into the Tetrarchy was not important because it makes you part
[02:28 --> 02:29] emperor.
[02:29 --> 02:34] It was important because it was the only way to qualify for the championship round.
[02:34 --> 02:38] And I think we all know that the prize for winning the championship round was sole control
[02:38 --> 02:41] of the Roman Empire.
[02:41 --> 02:46] So I hope everyone is ready to keep up with the rapid-fire horse trading, alliance hopping,
[02:46 --> 02:51] and double-crossing that is about to go down in pursuit of the championship, because I
[02:51 --> 02:54] can tell you one thing for sure.
[02:54 --> 02:57] Constantine is.
[02:57 --> 03:02] You'll recall from last week that as Maxentius was preparing Italy for the imminent invasion
[03:02 --> 03:07] of Galerius, he managed to secure an alliance with Constantine that would keep the newly
[03:07 --> 03:09] minted Caesar out of the fighting.
[03:09 --> 03:15] I mentioned that the key to this alliance was a marriage to Maxentius' sister, Fausta.
[03:15 --> 03:19] But I forgot to mention the other key part of the bargain.
[03:19 --> 03:25] With Severus dead, the western Augustus lot was open, and Constantine demanded that the
[03:25 --> 03:35] ex-emperor Maximian use his prestige to unilaterally promote his soon-to-be-son-in-law to the position.
[03:35 --> 03:39] Maxentius and his father agreed to the terms, and in the summer of 307, probably not long
[03:39 --> 03:46] after Galerius' withdrawal from Italy, though I'm not sure about that, a ceremony unfolded
[03:46 --> 03:53] that saw Maximian hand Constantine first his daughter in marriage, and then the title Augustus.
[03:53 --> 03:58] Though Constantine's promotion was essentially self-proclaimed, there was no one around to
[03:58 --> 04:05] stop him, and unlike the last time this happened, when he ultimately accepted demotion to Caesar,
[04:05 --> 04:10] this time around, and for the rest of his life, Constantine never would give up the
[04:10 --> 04:15] title Augustus.
[04:15 --> 04:19] For the briefest of moments, even though the western and eastern halves of the empire were
[04:19 --> 04:25] at each other's throats, on either side of the divide there was relative peace.
[04:25 --> 04:29] But that, too, was about to fall apart.
[04:29 --> 04:35] In the west, it seems that Maximian had, for a while now, been making the rather bold assumption
[04:35 --> 04:39] that now that he was back, he was back.
[04:39 --> 04:47] Augustus, superior in rank and prestige to Constantine and Maxentius the whole bit.
[04:47 --> 04:52] But Maxentius, finally coming into his own, had no intention of ceding any real authority
[04:52 --> 04:54] to his father.
[04:54 --> 04:58] As far as Maxentius was concerned, Maximian was a relic.
[04:58 --> 05:02] A useful relic, but a relic nonetheless.
[05:02 --> 05:08] Over the course of the winter of 307-308, Maxentius and his father Maximian resided
[05:08 --> 05:13] together in Rome, and when they discovered the assumptions the other had been making,
[05:13 --> 05:17] they began to feud immediately.
[05:17 --> 05:21] Things came to a head in the spring, when Maximian got up in front of the troops and
[05:21 --> 05:27] publicly denounced his own son, going so far as to physically wrestle off Maxentius'
[05:27 --> 05:29] purple cloak.
[05:29 --> 05:35] But Maxentius had spread the wealth around generously, and the troops in Italy were his
[05:35 --> 05:41] to a man now, and they did not take kindly to this old has-been, manhandling their new,
[05:41 --> 05:45] and did I mention generous, benefactor.
[05:45 --> 05:51] His denunciation backfiring completely, Maximian fled the city, and with nowhere else to go,
[05:51 --> 05:59] headed for Nicomedia, where he hoped, get this, that Galerius would take him in.
[05:59 --> 06:04] With his father out of the way, Maxentius probably hoped things would calm down a bit.
[06:04 --> 06:09] But almost as soon as the old man was gone, word came up to Rome that Domitius Alexander,
[06:09 --> 06:16] the vicar of Africa, had had himself proclaimed emperor by the troops at Carthage, a proclamation
[06:16 --> 06:21] that had apparently been sparked after Maxentius demanded Alexander send a son to Rome to act
[06:21 --> 06:24] as a hostage.
[06:24 --> 06:30] This was bad news for Maxentius, as North Africa was the source of Italy's grain supply.
[06:30 --> 06:33] But for the moment, there was nothing he could do about it.
[06:33 --> 06:38] He couldn't turn away from the main game with Galerius just yet.
[06:38 --> 06:43] But once he was legitimated within the Tetrarchy, which is something Maxentius no doubt expected
[06:43 --> 06:50] straight away, he would deal with Alexander.
[06:50 --> 06:56] Back in Nicomedia, Galerius was still fuming over his forced retreat when Maximian suddenly
[06:56 --> 06:59] appeared on his doorstep.
[06:59 --> 07:04] It is kind of surprising that the Eastern Augustus did not just have the old man executed
[07:04 --> 07:10] straight away for killing his western counterpart, but Galerius checked his wrath and instead
[07:10 --> 07:14] granted Maximian asylum.
[07:14 --> 07:18] At this point, it is likely that Galerius knew what he wanted his next move in the game
[07:18 --> 07:24] to be and realized that Maximian could be useful.
[07:24 --> 07:29] Because the next move Galerius wanted to make was convince Diocletian to come out of retirement
[07:29 --> 07:34] and help him resettle the political order.
[07:34 --> 07:38] Galerius may not have been able to impose his own will on his new colleagues, but he
[07:38 --> 07:42] had always had a knack for getting his way with Diocletian.
[07:42 --> 07:47] And Diocletian was the only man in the Empire who the other Tetrarchs would actually listen
[07:47 --> 07:48] to.
[07:48 --> 07:57] So, get Diocletian to ratify Galerius' will and voila, a new, new order of things.
[07:57 --> 08:02] With Maximian in hand, Galerius could now bill the meeting not as a desperate plea for
[08:02 --> 08:08] Diocletian's gravitas, but instead as a summit of the original Tetrarchs, minus the
[08:08 --> 08:14] late Constantius of course, to reconsider the organization of the successor Tetrarchy,
[08:14 --> 08:19] which was at present a bloody mess.
[08:19 --> 08:26] Diocletian, three years into his retirement, finally agreed to the meeting and in November
[08:27 --> 08:31] traveled from his palace in modern Croatia to one of the military cities along the Danube
[08:31 --> 08:36] River to meet with Galerius and Maximian.
[08:36 --> 08:41] When the three Emperors were once again in the same room, Maximian wasted no time begging
[08:41 --> 08:48] Diocletian to come out of retirement so they could once again be the senior Augusti together.
[08:48 --> 08:54] But Diocletian had no interest at all in returning to power and allegedly told Maximian that
[08:54 --> 08:59] if his old friend were to come see the magnificent cabbages he was now growing, that he too would
[08:59 --> 09:03] turn his back on the pursuit of worldly power.
[09:03 --> 09:11] It was agreed then that Diocletian would stay retired and that Maximian, look at me Maximian,
[09:11 --> 09:14] you are going to stay retired too.
[09:14 --> 09:21] No more hopping down drunkenly from the stands to steal the ball from the kids, you got it?
[09:22 --> 09:27] Galerius had to breathe a sigh of relief at Diocletian's response as Diocletian coming
[09:27 --> 09:32] out of retirement was the one scenario that would muck up his plan which could now proceed
[09:32 --> 09:35] as follows.
[09:35 --> 09:40] Galerius would stay Augustus of the east with Maximinus Dio as his Caesar.
[09:40 --> 09:45] Constantine would be demoted back down to Caesar despite his self-proclaimed promotion
[09:45 --> 09:47] to Augustus.
[09:47 --> 09:54] Instead a newcomer and of course old friend of Galerius's, Gaius Valerius Lichinianus
[09:54 --> 10:00] Lichinius would be vaulted directly into the role of Augustus of the west.
[10:00 --> 10:09] Maxentius holding Rome and Alexander holding Carthage would both be declared illegal usurpers.
[10:09 --> 10:14] The bargain struck and Diocletian returned to his happy retirement, Maximian to his unhappy
[10:14 --> 10:21] retirement and Galerius to his role as senior Augustus of a newly minted tetrarchy.
[10:21 --> 10:26] Himself Lichinius, Maximinus Dio and Constantine.
[10:26 --> 10:29] It had Diocletian's seal of approval.
[10:29 --> 10:34] What could possibly go wrong?
[10:34 --> 10:40] To say that this was a pretty crappy reorganization of the tetrarchy is a bit of an understatement.
[10:40 --> 10:44] As soon as the other principals were informed of the little committee's decision, there
[10:44 --> 10:51] were at least three men wielding large armies who were instantly ticked off.
[10:51 --> 10:56] Maxentius because he had been snubbed yet again, Constantine because they were trying
[10:56 --> 11:02] to bust him back to Caesar and Maximinus Dio because he was still just a Caesar while
[11:02 --> 11:07] Lichinius, the noob of the bunch, suddenly outranked him.
[11:07 --> 11:12] How Galerius, who was clearly the driving force behind this realignment, thought that
[11:12 --> 11:18] this quote unquote compromise was going to work is a mystery to everyone.
[11:18 --> 11:22] But there it was.
[11:22 --> 11:26] Before I move on, I should probably do the thing where I give you a little thumbnail
[11:26 --> 11:32] sketch of Lichinius's pre-imperial life, especially since the newest member of the
[11:32 --> 11:36] tetrarchy will also prove to be one of its longest serving members.
[11:36 --> 11:41] And in the end, the final, final match of the championship round will be fought between
[11:41 --> 11:46] him and Constantine.
[11:46 --> 11:51] The new Augustus, like every other emperor of his age, was born to peasant stock, Dacian
[11:51 --> 11:57] peasant stock to be exact, in the mid-260s AD, and he was raised in the rough border
[11:57 --> 12:00] province of Moesia.
[12:00 --> 12:05] Being about the same age and being from about the same place, Lichinius and Galerius had
[12:05 --> 12:11] apparently hooked up with each other at a young age and become fast friends.
[12:11 --> 12:16] When Galerius's imperial star rose, Lichinius rose with him, and he served alongside his
[12:16 --> 12:22] old friend during the wars in Persia in the late 290s AD.
[12:22 --> 12:27] After that, he appears to have served on Galerius's staff as a highly trusted advisor.
[12:27 --> 12:32] So trusted that it was Lichinius who was left in charge of the Danube frontier when
[12:32 --> 12:36] Galerius left for Italy to confront Maxentius.
[12:36 --> 12:42] And then so trusted that when a new Augustus needed to be appointed, Galerius pushed for
[12:42 --> 12:46] his old friend Lichinius.
[12:46 --> 12:50] When Diocletian, for whatever reason, gave his blessing, Lichinius was elevated to the
[12:50 --> 12:56] purple in 308, and despite the fact that his presence in the imperial college was annoying
[12:56 --> 13:02] as all get out to everyone but Galerius, he managed to deftly maneuver around the myriad
[13:02 --> 13:08] political landmines of the early 4th century, and he hung around for a surprising 16 years
[13:08 --> 13:17] before finally being blown up by Constantine in 324 AD.
[13:17 --> 13:22] As I just hinted though, the settlement hashed out between Galerius, Diocletian, and Maximian
[13:22 --> 13:27] ultimately created more problems than it solved.
[13:27 --> 13:32] Maximinus' diet had so far been the most stable part of the tetrarchy, but now he became
[13:32 --> 13:36] embittered at having been passed over for promotion.
[13:36 --> 13:41] Out in the west, Constantine simply ignored his demotion back to Caesar and instead went
[13:41 --> 13:47] right on calling himself Augustus, something that caused acute embarrassment to the rest
[13:47 --> 13:52] of the tetrarchy as there was really very little they could do to stop Constantine from
[13:52 --> 13:57] calling himself whatever he wanted.
[13:57 --> 14:01] Realizing that he had miscalculated a bit, Galerius attempted to soothe both of their
[14:01 --> 14:08] egos by giving the two Caesars the further title, Sons of Augustus, but the transparent
[14:08 --> 14:12] sop was seen for what it was by both.
[14:12 --> 14:17] In the east, the unmolified Maximinus' diet would choose to follow Constantine's lead
[14:17 --> 14:23] instead and began to simply assert his own promotion to Augustus by 310 AD.
[14:23 --> 14:33] And in the west, well, Constantine never stopped calling himself Augustus, even for a minute.
[14:33 --> 14:39] The wild card following the settlement of 308 was Maxentius, still in control of Italy
[14:39 --> 14:43] and still lacking any sort of legitimacy.
[14:43 --> 14:47] Galerius' first mission on behalf of the tetrarchy was supposed to have been bring
[14:47 --> 14:54] Italy and Africa back into their hands, but as Severus and Galerius had demonstrated,
[14:54 --> 15:00] that was easier said than done, and the new western Augustus never would initiate a concentrated
[15:00 --> 15:03] effort to oust Maxentius from Rome.
[15:03 --> 15:09] That effort, as we will see next week, will be undertaken instead by Constantine, leading
[15:09 --> 15:13] to one of the most famous and most important battles in the whole long history of the
[15:13 --> 15:18] world, the Battle of the Milvian Bridge.
[15:18 --> 15:25] The other wild card in all this, the really, really wild card at this point, was Maximian.
[15:25 --> 15:31] Pushed back into retirement, despised by Galerius and Maximinus' diet, and obviously on the
[15:31 --> 15:36] out with his own son, the only imperial court that would accept the old man was his new
[15:36 --> 15:41] son-in-law, Constantine's, settled at that point in Britain.
[15:41 --> 15:46] At first, Constantine was only too happy to secure for himself the further prestige of
[15:46 --> 15:52] having the old Augustus around, but it did not take long for Maximian to chafe under
[15:52 --> 15:56] the weight of his own impotence and cause trouble.
[15:56 --> 16:04] Trouble that will lead the once noble Maximian to a most ignoble end.
[16:04 --> 16:08] Things were pretty quiet for the first year or so, as Constantine continued to tour his
[16:08 --> 16:15] provinces and campaign periodically against the Germans, but in 310, as Constantine began
[16:15 --> 16:20] a more strenuous little war against the Franks, Maximian seized what he thought looked a lot
[16:20 --> 16:27] like an opportunity, though it would turn out to be nothing of the kind.
[16:27 --> 16:30] Constantine had dispatched his father-in-law to southern Gaul with a contingent of troops
[16:30 --> 16:36] to keep an eye on the Alpine passes and make sure Maxentius stayed in Italy while Constantine
[16:36 --> 16:38] fought the Franks.
[16:38 --> 16:45] But instead of remaining on guard duty, Maximian decided, sort of out of the blue, hey, I think
[16:45 --> 16:48] I want to be the senior western emperor again.
[16:48 --> 16:53] So he spread the word that Constantine had died in battle and further declared that he
[16:53 --> 16:56] was an Augustus again.
[16:56 --> 16:59] But the world had already moved on.
[16:59 --> 17:04] In a replay of his confrontation with Maxentius two years earlier, Maximian discovered that
[17:04 --> 17:10] whatever his past exploits, a new generation of emperors now commanded the loyalty of the
[17:10 --> 17:11] troops.
[17:11 --> 17:18] The soldiers under his command balked at following Maximian and instead decided to wait for independent
[17:18 --> 17:21] confirmation that Constantine really was dead.
[17:21 --> 17:26] When it became obvious that Constantine was really not dead, and that having heard of
[17:26 --> 17:32] Maximian's little ruse, he was now marching south with all deliberate speed, Maximian
[17:32 --> 17:36] attempted to bribe the troops into following him, but they weren't having it.
[17:36 --> 17:40] To follow Maximian would be to die with Maximian.
[17:40 --> 17:45] Of that, they had no doubt.
[17:45 --> 17:50] So Maximian headed to Marseille, which was both defensible and housed some troops who
[17:50 --> 17:54] still remembered their old commander fondly.
[17:54 --> 17:58] But these men were by far a minority in the city.
[17:58 --> 18:03] Constantine had been more or less in charge of Britain and Gaul for the last four years,
[18:03 --> 18:10] and in that time he had made a hugely positive impact on everyone, soldier and civilian alike.
[18:10 --> 18:15] He was attentive to the needs of the citizens, undertook rebuilding projects after years
[18:15 --> 18:21] of neglect, promoted the arts, and was generally seen as productive, responsive, and wise beyond
[18:21 --> 18:24] his years.
[18:24 --> 18:30] There was no way anyone was going to abandon him for the old man Maximian.
[18:30 --> 18:35] So I'm not sure how many hours passed from the time Constantine showed up at Marseille
[18:35 --> 18:40] to the time that the back door was opened for him by a loyal subject inside the city,
[18:40 --> 18:45] but it seems like it was probably somewhere in the single digits.
[18:45 --> 18:52] Maximian was tracked down and captured, and then hauled before an extremely irate Constantine.
[18:52 --> 18:56] Constantine explained to Maximian that out of filial duty, he was not just going to kill
[18:56 --> 19:00] his father-in-law, as he would any other rebel.
[19:00 --> 19:06] But if Maximian were to say, take this opportunity to save everyone future headaches by, you
[19:06 --> 19:13] know, doing the right thing, that Constantine would not at all be adverse to that.
[19:13 --> 19:20] At some point in July of 310, Maximian did the right thing, and hanged himself.
[19:20 --> 19:25] He was about 60 years old, and not so very long ago, had been a successful emperor for
[19:25 --> 19:34] 20 years, but now, rather than dying a hero to the empire, he died instead a broken disgrace.
[19:34 --> 19:37] It was a sad end.
[19:37 --> 19:43] Sure, without Diocletian, Maximian was a complete disaster, but up until the very end, he did
[19:43 --> 19:49] have Diocletian, and so for most of his life, he was not a complete disaster.
[19:49 --> 19:54] And though he died a hated man, he would sort of get the last laugh genetically, as it would
[19:54 --> 20:00] be his grandsons, and his great-grandsons, who would eventually come to rule the empire
[20:00 --> 20:06] following the reign of Constantine.
[20:06 --> 20:11] The most immediate impact of Maximian's death was that it drove a wedge between Maxentius
[20:11 --> 20:14] and Constantine.
[20:14 --> 20:20] Up until now, the two had coexisted more or less peacefully, and the shared link of Fausta,
[20:20 --> 20:26] Maxentius's sister, and Constantine's wife, helped secure the peace.
[20:26 --> 20:32] But after Maximian's death, things began to get ugly.
[20:32 --> 20:37] We have no way of knowing whether the story is true, but not long after Maximian hanged
[20:37 --> 20:43] himself, Constantine began passing it around that his father-in-law's suicide had nothing
[20:43 --> 20:48] to do with the little rebellion Maximian had cooked up, and instead, had everything to
[20:48 --> 20:53] do with Maximian plotting to kill Constantine, despite having been so generously allowed
[20:53 --> 20:56] to live.
[20:56 --> 21:02] The key plot twist of this story was that Maximian had taken Fausta into his confidence,
[21:02 --> 21:07] and that she had decided to betray her father to her husband, which cannot have gone over
[21:07 --> 21:14] too well with her brother, even if he and his father were estranged.
[21:14 --> 21:19] Constantine then went further, and announced that Maximian's memory was henceforth damned.
[21:19 --> 21:24] Throughout his provinces, provinces that had once been Maximian's, Constantine tore down
[21:24 --> 21:33] statues and defaced monuments, crossing out any reference to or mention of the old Augustus.
[21:33 --> 21:37] It appears that this was then picked up by the eastern tetrarchs, neither of whom liked
[21:37 --> 21:41] Maximian one bit.
[21:41 --> 21:47] This shabby treatment of his father's memory angered Maxentius, and he began styling himself
[21:47 --> 21:52] now as the dutiful son, despite the fact that he and his father had no longer even been
[21:52 --> 21:55] on speaking terms.
[21:55 --> 22:01] And he was thus able to add defense of father's honor to his list of reasons for continuing
[22:01 --> 22:07] to stand against the tetrarchy.
[22:07 --> 22:11] But before he could exact his revenge on the tetrarchs, who just kept poking him in the
[22:11 --> 22:17] eye every chance they got, Maxentius needed to clean up his own backyard.
[22:17 --> 22:23] And so, in either 310 or 311, he ordered his Praetorian prefect to lead an invasion of
[22:23 --> 22:29] North Africa, crush Domitius Alexander, and unclench the usurper's stranglehold on the
[22:29 --> 22:37] grain supply, a stranglehold that was undermining Maxentius's popularity in Rome.
[22:37 --> 22:42] Further heightening Maxentius's sense of urgency was the rumor going around that Constantine
[22:42 --> 22:47] had entered into talks with Alexander to discuss what kind of pincer move they might
[22:47 --> 22:51] be able to jointly put on Italy.
[22:51 --> 22:56] Whether that rumor is true or not soon became irrelevant though, as Maxentius's prefect
[22:56 --> 23:01] arrived in Carthage, steamrolled the lesser African troops, and then captured Alexander
[23:01 --> 23:05] and had him put to death.
[23:05 --> 23:09] With Africa back under his control, Maxentius felt that he was now fully prepared to meet
[23:09 --> 23:14] whatever the tetrarchy had to throw at him.
[23:14 --> 23:23] But before anyone had a chance to do anything, the political apple cart was once again overturned.
[23:23 --> 23:27] In mid-311, after having spent the last few years peacefully resigned to the fact that
[23:27 --> 23:32] he was never going to be the great puppet master that Diocletian had been, Galerius
[23:32 --> 23:34] got sick.
[23:34 --> 23:36] Really sick.
[23:36 --> 23:40] And if you believe Eusebius, the Christian writer who took particular joy in the suffering
[23:40 --> 23:45] of the great persecutor, really, really sick.
[23:45 --> 23:50] Like no matter how many baths he took, the stench of Galerius's rotting insides could
[23:50 --> 23:54] be smelled throughout the city sick.
[23:54 --> 23:59] As I mentioned a few episodes back, when Galerius sensed that the end was near, he decreed an
[23:59 --> 24:05] end to the great persecution, admitting that for all the violent coercion of the past decade,
[24:05 --> 24:09] the Christians remained as obstinate as ever.
[24:09 --> 24:17] In essence, the persecution has failed spectacularly, and it is time to admit defeat.
[24:17 --> 24:22] But Galerius would fail even in his attempt to end the persecution in the east.
[24:22 --> 24:26] After all, that was the only place it was really still going on anymore.
[24:26 --> 24:31] And once he was dead, Maximinus Dio, who was not at all ready to admit defeat, revived
[24:32 --> 24:36] and set it back on its murderous path.
[24:36 --> 24:40] But that was all someone else's problem now.
[24:40 --> 24:46] In May of 311, whatever was killing Galerius, gangrene, bowel cancer, whatever, finally
[24:46 --> 24:48] killed him.
[24:48 --> 24:54] He was about 51 years old and had helped rule the empire, first as a Caesar, then as an
[24:54 --> 25:02] Augustus, then as the senior Augustus, for about 18 years.
[25:02 --> 25:07] I think at the end of the day, we have to see Galerius mostly as a failure.
[25:07 --> 25:13] He was a good lieutenant, and his triumph over the Sassanids should never be discounted.
[25:13 --> 25:18] But once he wielded power in his own right, his legacy boils down to the great persecution,
[25:19 --> 25:25] policy that did a lot of damage for no measurable return, and a series of attempts to manipulate
[25:25 --> 25:32] the Tetrarchy to his advantage, all of which blew up in his and the empire's face.
[25:32 --> 25:37] He wasn't the worst emperor of all time, but I think you can lay the blame for a pretty
[25:37 --> 25:43] good chunk of the chaos and bloodshed of the early 4th century at his doorstep.
[25:43 --> 25:48] Maybe everything was destined to fall apart, but the way Galerius arranged for it to play
[25:48 --> 25:55] out all but guaranteed it.
[25:55 --> 25:59] Next week, the real unraveling will begin.
[25:59 --> 26:06] The four main powers left, Maximinus Dio, Constantine, Maxentius, and Lycinius, will
[26:06 --> 26:12] pair up to face off against the other two, Constantine with Lycinius and Maximinus Dio
[26:12 --> 26:15] with Maxentius.
[26:15 --> 26:21] After Constantine and Lycinius successfully beat down Maxentius and Maximinus, they will
[26:21 --> 26:27] for a time peacefully coexist, ruling over west and east respectively, until Constantine
[26:27 --> 26:34] will finally decide in 324 AD that his destiny has been put off long enough.

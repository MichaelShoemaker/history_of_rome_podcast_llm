[01:05 --> 01:14] Hello and welcome to The History of Rome, episode 76, Mock Triumphs.
[01:14 --> 01:19] Last time, we traced Domitian's rise to power from forgotten afterthought to emperor of
[01:19 --> 01:21] the Roman Empire.
[01:21 --> 01:25] Unlike his brother, Domitian's rise had no planned arc.
[01:25 --> 01:30] There was no gentle addition of responsibility, no subtle raising of the volume.
[01:30 --> 01:35] When it came to Domitian, one minute there was silence, the next the amp was cranked
[01:35 --> 01:36] to ten.
[01:36 --> 01:41] Imperial non-entity to master of the world in just the blink of an eye.
[01:41 --> 01:46] His sudden inheritance of the throne shocked everyone as the citizens of the empire were
[01:46 --> 01:51] just getting settled in to the nice long reign of Titus and there was fear all around that
[01:51 --> 01:55] the thirty year old Domitian would not be up to the task.
[01:55 --> 01:59] But this fear was generally unfounded and Domitian would prove both intellectually and
[01:59 --> 02:03] politically that he had what it took to be emperor.
[02:03 --> 02:08] Even though his blunt dismissal of the senate eventually led to assassination, for fifteen
[02:08 --> 02:13] years Domitian ruled effectively in the manner he saw fit and efficiently got done what he
[02:13 --> 02:15] thought needed to be done.
[02:15 --> 02:21] The reign of Domitian is not to be sneezed at or ignored or ridiculed, though neither
[02:21 --> 02:25] is it to be embraced as the second coming of Augustus as Domitian would have liked us
[02:25 --> 02:30] to believe, and in many ways he set the stage for the coming century of brilliance for the
[02:30 --> 02:31] empire.
[02:31 --> 02:36] Suetonius once commented that the depravity of the last Flavian practically negated the
[02:36 --> 02:40] good of the first two, but this is propaganda.
[02:40 --> 02:45] Domitian was harsher and colder than his brother and father, but he was as astute and
[02:45 --> 02:50] capable a man as they, and in the end the whole of the Flavian dynasty should be remembered
[02:50 --> 02:55] for their successful stewardship of the empire.
[02:55 --> 03:00] Domitian opened his reign, as I said last time, with a flurry of pious construction
[03:00 --> 03:05] projects, completing the temple of Jupiter and unveiling a temple for his now divine
[03:05 --> 03:08] relatives Titus and Vespasian.
[03:08 --> 03:11] But he did not plan to stop at a few temples.
[03:11 --> 03:16] The city of Rome had been ravaged by war and natural disaster, most recently suffering
[03:16 --> 03:21] from the great fire of ADAD, and Domitian saw an opportunity to kick off his planned
[03:21 --> 03:24] Augustan renaissance in style.
[03:24 --> 03:30] The first emperor had famously inherited a city of brick and left it a city of marble.
[03:30 --> 03:35] Domitian was inheriting a city of ashes, and he planned to leave it a city of, well, buildings
[03:35 --> 03:36] and stuff.
[03:36 --> 03:39] Something functional, anyway.
[03:39 --> 03:43] That didn't turn out nearly as poetic as I hoped when I started that sentence.
[03:43 --> 03:47] Over the course of the next few years, he would direct the completion of some fifty
[03:47 --> 03:52] new buildings, restoring the architectural dignity of Rome, which had been in steep decline
[03:52 --> 03:55] since the reign of Nero.
[03:55 --> 03:59] Among his many projects was the Arch of Titus, which was completed soon after his brother's
[03:59 --> 04:01] death.
[04:01 --> 04:06] The great arch, which still stands today and is a can't-miss on any trip to Rome, ostensibly
[04:06 --> 04:12] commemorates Titus's victory in Judea, but mostly, its job was to remind everyone of
[04:12 --> 04:17] the divine, almost mythological status of the Flavians.
[04:17 --> 04:20] Whether or not the Romans saw it as anything more than outsized self-aggrandizement is
[04:20 --> 04:25] an open question, but the grand permanence of the structure certainly convinced later
[04:25 --> 04:31] ambitious men that a massive arch was a pretty sweet way to celebrate one's own eternal
[04:31 --> 04:33] awesomeness.
[04:33 --> 04:37] Napoleon certainly had the Arch of Titus in mind when he ordered the Arc de Triomphe built
[04:37 --> 04:42] after his own great victory at Austerlitz in 1806.
[04:42 --> 04:46] All of these public building projects helped stimulate an economy that had been drifting
[04:46 --> 04:52] aimlessly for years, but of course they were not going to pay for themselves.
[04:52 --> 04:58] So having undercut the Roman elite politically, Domitian next targeted them economically and
[04:58 --> 05:04] let his newly reformed and ruthlessly efficient bureaucracy loose on their bank accounts.
[05:04 --> 05:08] He strengthened and extended imperial taxes, and in the years to come would eventually
[05:08 --> 05:14] resort to outright confiscation to help pay for his projects, and of course the various
[05:14 --> 05:19] military campaigns he initiated, which we'll get to in a bit.
[05:19 --> 05:23] If he were another man, Domitian would have paid for everything without resorting to excessive
[05:23 --> 05:25] taxation.
[05:25 --> 05:29] Emperors in the past had simply borrowed what they needed without regard for how they were
[05:29 --> 05:31] going to pay it back.
[05:31 --> 05:36] Besides, if the creditors did come calling, an emperor could simply devalue the coins
[05:36 --> 05:41] he minted until he had enough nominal chunks of worthless metal to pay the specific amounts
[05:41 --> 05:44] that everyone demanded.
[05:44 --> 05:48] Domitian had no interest in inflating his way into solvency though, and taking the opposite
[05:48 --> 05:53] tack, he actually returned the silver ratio in a denarii back to the Augustan level of
[05:53 --> 05:56] 12%.
[05:56 --> 06:00] Roman currency was the standard in the Mediterranean at the time, and Domitian felt that it reflected
[06:00 --> 06:05] badly on the emperor to have the coins he minted regarded as worthless jokes.
[06:05 --> 06:10] But of course, with less circulating currency to work with, Domitian was forced to demand
[06:10 --> 06:12] more from his subjects.
[06:12 --> 06:17] The Roman economy on balance benefited from Domitian's fiscal policies, but they certainly
[06:17 --> 06:21] did not help his popularity any.
[06:21 --> 06:26] Reducing his popularity even less than his tax policies was his hopeless quest to return
[06:26 --> 06:31] the Romans to their traditional conservative family values.
[06:31 --> 06:36] Legislating sex and morals had been hard enough for Augustus a century earlier, but Domitian's
[06:36 --> 06:41] attempt to revive these least successful policies of the first emperor turned out to be an even
[06:41 --> 06:43] more terrible idea.
[06:43 --> 06:47] But Domitian seemed dead set on reviving all things Augustan, even if it meant bringing
[06:47 --> 06:51] back the much-derided Lex Julia.
[06:51 --> 06:57] In 85 AD, Domitian named himself censor in perpetuity, which gave him authority to legislate
[06:57 --> 06:59] public morality.
[06:59 --> 07:04] Adultery once again became a banishable offense, and consorting with the Vestal Virgins became
[07:04 --> 07:06] a capital crime.
[07:06 --> 07:11] An equestrian found himself stricken from the juror pool for remarrying an ex-wife,
[07:11 --> 07:15] and a senator was expelled from the body for acting on stage, which was even worse than
[07:15 --> 07:19] prostitution so far as Domitian was concerned.
[07:19 --> 07:23] All of this turned out to be little more than spitting into a hurricane, and Domitian
[07:23 --> 07:27] earned himself nothing but scorn for his trouble.
[07:27 --> 07:31] The old ways were dead, threatening to execute people for cheating on their wives was not
[07:31 --> 07:34] going to change that.
[07:34 --> 07:39] But Domitian forged on, and his efforts at re-establishing some semblance of public morality
[07:39 --> 07:42] was not a total fool's errand.
[07:42 --> 07:47] The emperor also used his authority as censor to punish officials for bribery and corruption,
[07:47 --> 07:52] through real offenses with real consequences that had been overlooked for years even by
[07:52 --> 07:54] his own father.
[07:54 --> 07:59] There was, as they say, a new sheriff in town, and even though he kicked up a lot of dust
[07:59 --> 08:03] and made a lot of enemies over ultimately irrelevant sexual stuff, the government was
[08:03 --> 08:09] never again as clean or honest in its dealings.
[08:09 --> 08:13] The funny thing about all of this is that Domitian kept stepping on the same toes over
[08:13 --> 08:15] and over again.
[08:15 --> 08:19] It seems like any time he had the opportunity to stick it to the nobility, he jumped at
[08:19 --> 08:20] the chance.
[08:20 --> 08:25] I'm not sure what the senate did to elicit such contempt from the emperor, I speculated
[08:25 --> 08:31] about some stuff last time, but he really really had it in for them.
[08:31 --> 08:35] So much so that it doesn't even seem like a matter of stepping on a few toes, more like
[08:35 --> 08:40] Domitian was walking right up to them and stomping down on their feet repeatedly.
[08:40 --> 08:45] He cut them out of the political process, gouged them financially, policed their bedrooms,
[08:45 --> 08:48] and shut down their lucrative kickbacks.
[08:48 --> 08:53] In the end, I'm not sure why Domitian hated the senate so much, but I have no doubts about
[08:53 --> 08:56] why they hated him so much.
[08:56 --> 08:59] He even declared a limit to the amount of arable Italian land that could be used for
[08:59 --> 09:01] vineyards.
[09:01 --> 09:05] So to top everything off, Domitian was also cutting down the booze supply.
[09:05 --> 09:11] Is it any wonder then that he was finally stabbed to death?
[09:11 --> 09:16] Beyond the aristocracy who uniformly hated him, Domitian was alternatively feared and
[09:16 --> 09:21] liked and disdained and respected depending on who you talked to.
[09:21 --> 09:28] But there was one segment of the population who really loved the man, rank and file soldiers.
[09:28 --> 09:31] The officers couldn't stand Domitian of course, for all the reasons I've mentioned and all
[09:31 --> 09:34] the reasons I'll get to shortly.
[09:34 --> 09:36] But the common legionary loved him.
[09:36 --> 09:38] Why the great discrepancy?
[09:38 --> 09:44] Because shortly after taking office, Domitian issued a blanket pay raise for his soldiers.
[09:44 --> 09:46] And it wasn't some cost of living increase either.
[09:46 --> 09:52] No, the common soldiers saw their paychecks increase by fully one third, a mind-blowing
[09:52 --> 09:58] sum that earned Domitian their undying devotion for the rest of his reign.
[09:58 --> 10:02] The elites could clamor for his head as much as they wanted, but after the pay raise they
[10:02 --> 10:06] were going to have a hell of a time convincing their soldiers to revolt.
[10:06 --> 10:07] You want me to fight who?
[10:07 --> 10:10] The guy who just gave me a 33% bump?
[10:10 --> 10:13] No, I think I'm good thanks.
[10:13 --> 10:17] The raise caused Domitian to backtrack on his fiscal policy sum and he was forced to
[10:17 --> 10:22] slightly devalue his coins after having so recently revalued them.
[10:22 --> 10:26] But the compromise was a sound one and Domitian never really had to worry about the whole
[10:26 --> 10:29] army rising up against him.
[10:29 --> 10:34] There was a brief revolt of two legions in 89 AD, which we'll get to next week.
[10:34 --> 10:39] But it was an isolated case and was quickly crushed by the intensely loyal armies that
[10:39 --> 10:43] surrounded the malcontents.
[10:43 --> 10:47] The pay raise for the soldiers did not come out of nowhere though.
[10:47 --> 10:52] It was part and parcel of the triumphal celebration following Domitian's smashing victory against
[10:52 --> 10:56] the Chatti in 83 AD.
[10:56 --> 11:00] The fierce Germanic tribe had suddenly risen up in revolt against Rome.
[11:00 --> 11:04] Right around the time Domitian decided that it was high time he cemented his reputation
[11:04 --> 11:08] as a great leader with an impressive military victory.
[11:08 --> 11:12] It was actually pretty convenient how it all worked out.
[11:12 --> 11:15] Domitian just happened to be in Chatti territory conducting a census with a new legion he
[11:15 --> 11:21] had recently formed when, for no reason, and in stark contrast to years of peaceful coexistence,
[11:21 --> 11:26] the dastardly Chatti attacked, forcing Domitian to defend the honor of the house of Caesar
[11:26 --> 11:30] and the majesty of Rome, etc., etc., etc.
[11:30 --> 11:31] Convenient.
[11:31 --> 11:35] Yes, that's one word for it.
[11:35 --> 11:39] Domitian marched around for a year building roads and fortifications in Chatti territory,
[11:39 --> 11:44] decided that with winter coming it was high time he declared victory and left, so he declared
[11:44 --> 11:46] victory and left.
[11:46 --> 11:51] He returned to Rome to celebrate the triumph he had been craving all his life.
[11:51 --> 11:55] No one who knew anything about anything believed Domitian had actually done anything to earn
[11:55 --> 11:57] the triumph he threw for himself.
[11:57 --> 12:01] He had what, skirmished with some random tribe and built some roads, and now was calling
[12:01 --> 12:03] himself Germanicus?
[12:03 --> 12:06] But the people loved it.
[12:06 --> 12:10] Triumphs mean games and banquets and generous handouts.
[12:10 --> 12:13] So they cheered their conquering emperor as he marched into the city at the head of his
[12:13 --> 12:15] great parade.
[12:15 --> 12:19] Domitian cheerfully basked in the glow of his adoring subjects.
[12:19 --> 12:24] Never again would he be relegated to the back with the other family members.
[12:24 --> 12:27] This was Domitian's time now.
[12:27 --> 12:32] Meanwhile, Tacitus, representing the views of the aristocracy, dismissed the whole display
[12:32 --> 12:36] as a mock triumph.
[12:36 --> 12:41] Real or mock, Domitian capped his celebration by announcing a pay raise for his brave soldiers.
[12:41 --> 12:45] That at least was real enough.
[12:45 --> 12:50] One possible side consequence of Domitian's mock triumph was that agricola, and yes, thank
[12:50 --> 12:56] you for the pronunciation correction, it is agricola, not agricola, which yeah, I agree,
[12:56 --> 13:00] sounds like some kind of terrible hippie soda, so I'm sorry about that.
[13:00 --> 13:06] Anyway, agricola was possibly recalled from his post in Britannia because his real military
[13:06 --> 13:12] success on the island cast Domitian's victory in a pretty pathetic light.
[13:12 --> 13:16] Not long after Domitian's parade, messengers delivered the news that agricola had defeated
[13:16 --> 13:21] the combined Caledonian army of some 30,000 troops and stood poised to capture the entire
[13:21 --> 13:22] island.
[13:22 --> 13:28] There is no consensus about whether agricola was recalled out of jealousy or whether it
[13:28 --> 13:33] was more like a reward for seven years' cold, hard service in the north, but one way or
[13:33 --> 13:40] the other, agricola was back in Rome in 85 AD and effectively retired from public life.
[13:40 --> 13:44] This had been one of the more successful careers of the first century, and he very
[13:44 --> 13:47] nearly captured the whole of Britannia for the Romans.
[13:47 --> 13:52] His work would be left permanently incomplete though, as the legions he had led were soon
[13:52 --> 13:56] transferred to the Danube to help fight the growing Dacian menace, which unlike the Chatti
[13:56 --> 14:01] menace was all too real.
[14:01 --> 14:05] The Dacians lived in the Carpathian mountains on the far side of the Danube and had been
[14:05 --> 14:07] stirring up trouble for years.
[14:07 --> 14:12] For the first time in his life, Domitian was about to deal with a real existential threat
[14:12 --> 14:14] to the empire.
[14:14 --> 14:18] His response to the crisis offered a window into how the emperor really felt about war,
[14:18 --> 14:21] defense and imperial security.
[14:21 --> 14:25] Whether he handled the situation properly is a matter of ongoing debate, but there is
[14:25 --> 14:31] no doubt that the hawkish aristocracy, already chafing under Domitian your lord and god,
[14:31 --> 14:36] were appalled by his handling of the Dacian situation.
[14:36 --> 14:42] The thing about Domitian is that he took Augustus's injunction about further conquest seriously
[14:42 --> 14:47] and really believed that the primary function of the legions was now frontier defense.
[14:47 --> 14:52] He didn't want to invade Germania, he didn't want to conquer Dacia, he didn't want anything
[14:52 --> 14:54] to do with Scotland.
[14:54 --> 14:58] He considered these efforts to be expensive boondoggles that would stretch the legions
[14:58 --> 15:04] too thin, cost blood and treasure Rome couldn't afford, and ultimately leave the empire weaker
[15:04 --> 15:07] and more vulnerable for the trouble.
[15:07 --> 15:12] When it came to military affairs, the great legacy of Domitian was not some new territory
[15:12 --> 15:17] added to the empire or some great foreign enemy destroyed, but rather the expansion
[15:17 --> 15:23] and strengthening of the Lymes Germanicus, the frontier fortification network along the
[15:23 --> 15:29] Rhine and Danube rivers that kept the northern empire safe from invasion.
[15:29 --> 15:34] Already stretching to nearly 350 miles, the fortification network grew to include 60 permanent
[15:34 --> 15:39] forts and some 900 watchtowers.
[15:39 --> 15:44] Domitian would neither begin the project nor complete it, but he was committed to it wholeheartedly
[15:44 --> 15:48] and poured money and manpower into the effort.
[15:48 --> 15:54] The key line the Lymes Germanicus cut was between the upper Rhine and the upper Danube.
[15:54 --> 15:59] While the two great rivers offered a natural defense on their own against un-pacified tribes,
[15:59 --> 16:03] the stretch of land between the headwaters of each was a dangerous weak point for the
[16:03 --> 16:08] empire, and Domitian aimed to close that gap once and for all.
[16:08 --> 16:12] Though his work would finally be completed by Hadrian, the time and effort Domitian expended
[16:12 --> 16:17] was critical and helped pave the way for a century and a half of security along the northern
[16:17 --> 16:20] border.
[16:20 --> 16:25] But while Domitian's efforts were critical, they were also criticized.
[16:25 --> 16:29] High ranking military officials and their civilian counterparts believed Domitian far
[16:29 --> 16:32] too passive in his military strategy.
[16:32 --> 16:37] If the empire was to be safe, it needed to defeat its enemies, not build a wall to keep
[16:37 --> 16:38] them out.
[16:38 --> 16:41] The fight needed to be taken to the source.
[16:41 --> 16:44] It was no good to simply sit back until it was too late.
[16:44 --> 16:50] What good was a watchtower if it only alerted Rome to an invasion force too strong to repel?
[16:50 --> 16:55] Nascent alliances between barbarian tribes needed to be nipped in the bud before they
[16:55 --> 16:58] grew into something truly dangerous.
[16:58 --> 17:02] Soldiers were trained to fight, not sit on walls staring into space.
[17:02 --> 17:04] It was unnatural.
[17:04 --> 17:09] The contrast in style came to a head in Dacia where each side could reasonably claim the
[17:09 --> 17:15] actions of the other detrimental to imperial security.
[17:15 --> 17:18] Ever since the year of the four emperors, the tribes beyond the northern frontiers of
[17:18 --> 17:22] the Danube had grown more and more bold.
[17:22 --> 17:27] The Roman world seemed too preoccupied to care about their raids into imperial territory,
[17:27 --> 17:32] and with each passing year the tribes, including the formidable Dacians, acted with increasing
[17:32 --> 17:34] impunity.
[17:34 --> 17:40] They finally crossed the line and got Rome's attention in either 84 or 85 AD when a Dacian
[17:40 --> 17:44] army invaded Moesia and killed the imperial governor.
[17:44 --> 17:48] Hot on the heels of his great victory over the Chatti, Domitian personally led a forced
[17:48 --> 17:53] to Moesia to deal with the unacceptable affront to Rome's honor.
[17:53 --> 17:59] Further signaling how seriously and how personally Domitian was taking the situation, his army
[17:59 --> 18:04] included members of the Praetorian Guard and was led by his Praetorian prefect, Cornelius
[18:04 --> 18:05] Fuscus.
[18:05 --> 18:09] The Roman reinforcements were able to easily drive off the Dacians who were not about to
[18:09 --> 18:14] tangle with an imperial army guided by the emperor himself.
[18:14 --> 18:19] By the winter of 85 the Dacians were cleared out of Roman territory and Domitian returned
[18:19 --> 18:22] to Rome to celebrate his second triumph.
[18:22 --> 18:27] Though there was still not much to celebrate, this triumph at least had a ring of truth
[18:27 --> 18:31] to it and Domitian was quite pleased with himself for how well his military career was
[18:31 --> 18:33] shaping up.
[18:33 --> 18:38] But this second triumph proved to be even more of a mockery than the first.
[18:38 --> 18:44] The Dacians were not defeated by a long shot and when Cornelius Fuscus, on his own initiative,
[18:44 --> 18:47] crossed the Danube to mop up the remaining combatants.
[18:47 --> 18:54] He led his legions to one of their worst defeats since the catastrophe in the Tudiburg forest.
[18:54 --> 19:01] In 86 AD, Fuscus led elements of four legions plus auxiliaries into Dacian territory expecting
[19:01 --> 19:05] little resistance from the splintered and feuding local tribes.
[19:05 --> 19:09] Except that the Dacians weren't splintered and feuding at all.
[19:09 --> 19:14] They had been united by a king who was to become known to the Romans as Decebalus, which
[19:14 --> 19:18] translates roughly as he with the strength of ten men.
[19:18 --> 19:23] Decebalus saw the Romans coming from a mile away and set an ambush at the narrow pass
[19:23 --> 19:25] of Tappi.
[19:25 --> 19:28] Fuscus blundered right into the trap.
[19:28 --> 19:33] He watched in horror as the entire fifth legion was cornered and massacred and then watched
[19:33 --> 19:38] in humiliation as the legionary standard of the Praetorian guard was captured and hauled
[19:38 --> 19:41] off by the enemy.
[19:41 --> 19:46] Luckily for Fuscus he did not have to live with the humiliation for long as he himself
[19:46 --> 19:50] was soon killed in the fighting.
[19:50 --> 19:55] Back in Rome, the triumphed mission had celebrated now seemed like a cruel joke.
[19:55 --> 20:00] He quickly returned to Moesia to oversee the reinforcement of the province.
[20:00 --> 20:04] He divided the territory into two administrative districts and transferred three legions to
[20:04 --> 20:08] boost the defenses along the Danube.
[20:08 --> 20:12] Though he was convinced now more than ever that the legions worked best as a defensive
[20:12 --> 20:17] force rather than conquering adventurers, the mission understood that the annihilation
[20:17 --> 20:22] of a legion and the capture of a standard, the Praetorian guard standard no less, could
[20:22 --> 20:25] not go unanswered.
[20:25 --> 20:30] In both 87 and 88 the Romans crossed the Danube to campaign against Decebalus, though this
[20:30 --> 20:36] time they marched with far greater care than had been shown by Fuscus.
[20:36 --> 20:41] In 88 the Dacians and Romans once again found themselves facing off at Tappi, though this
[20:41 --> 20:48] time the Romans did not stumble blindly into any traps and Decebalus was soundly beaten.
[20:48 --> 20:52] All would seem to be well for Domitian and the Romans, their honor was restored and the
[20:52 --> 20:58] enemy beaten, but unfortunately for Domitian, events elsewhere conspired to turn his victory
[20:58 --> 21:01] into a bleeding sore.
[21:01 --> 21:07] On January 1, 89 AD, Lucius Antonius Saturnius, the governor of Upper Germania, had had enough
[21:07 --> 21:12] of Domitian and led his two legions in revolt.
[21:12 --> 21:16] With this sudden crisis on the Rhine, Domitian was forced to conclude a hasty treaty with
[21:16 --> 21:21] Decebalus that formally recognized Dacia as a client kingdom of Rome.
[21:21 --> 21:27] To ensure that there would be no trouble after he left, Domitian accepted a controversial
[21:27 --> 21:33] provision that sent money and artisans to Decebalus in exchange for peace.
[21:33 --> 21:38] The money and men would be used by the Dacian king to bolster his own defenses and properly
[21:38 --> 21:41] equip his growing army.
[21:41 --> 21:46] Domitian's treaty had the effect of transforming Roman tax dollars into Dacian swords and putting
[21:46 --> 21:52] Romans to work, building walls that later Romans would die trying to climb.
[21:53 --> 21:57] The officer corps was already grumbling about Domitian's cowardly obsession with roads and
[21:57 --> 22:04] watchtowers, but for him to pay off an enemy like that was borderline dereliction of duty.
[22:04 --> 22:05] And they had a point.
[22:05 --> 22:10] When Trajan decided to eventually crush Decebalus once and for all, he found the task far more
[22:10 --> 22:15] arduous than it should have been because of all the enemy fortifications built with Roman
[22:15 --> 22:16] money.
[22:16 --> 22:21] For the record, Decebalus did control lucrative gold mines that bought and paid for most of
[22:21 --> 22:26] his army, lucrative gold mines that had far more to do with Trajan's decision to invade
[22:26 --> 22:30] than abstract notions of defending Roman honor, by the way.
[22:30 --> 22:35] But still, the optics of Domitian's treaty were terrible, and the deal with Decebalus
[22:35 --> 22:40] soon became a political wound that refused to heal.
[22:40 --> 22:44] Next week, we'll start with the revolt of Saturnius, which would prove to be a turning
[22:44 --> 22:47] point in Domitian's reign.
[22:47 --> 22:52] Prior to the uprising, Domitian was harsh but fair in his use of imperial power.
[22:52 --> 22:58] But afterwards, the emperor would become far more paranoid and far more cruel.
[22:58 --> 23:03] Though in the end he would execute for treason no more men than the lovable, huggable Uncle
[23:03 --> 23:09] Claudius, the last years of Domitian's reign would nonetheless go down in history as a
[23:09 --> 23:10] reign of terror.
[23:10 --> 23:15] Eventually, a conspiracy of court officials would determine that they had better kill
[23:15 --> 23:18] the emperor before he killed them.
[23:18 --> 23:24] And on September 1896 AD, Domitian finally met the violent end that he had always suspected
[23:24 --> 23:25] would be his to meet.

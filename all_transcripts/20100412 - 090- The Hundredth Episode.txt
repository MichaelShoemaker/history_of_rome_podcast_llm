[00:38 --> 00:41] This week, I'm going to make kind of a strange recommendation.
[00:41 --> 00:46] Apparently, Audible is putting out these little 5-minute segments for kids on things like
[00:46 --> 00:49] whales and dinosaurs and volcanoes.
[00:49 --> 00:53] Well, they have one for the Roman Empire and one for Julius Caesar.
[00:53 --> 00:57] If your kids are too young for the history of Rome, by all means, this is a great place
[00:57 --> 01:00] to get them started.
[01:00 --> 01:05] Just remember to go to audiblepodcast.com forward slash realm so that they know who sent you.
[01:10 --> 01:15] Hello and welcome to the history of Rome.
[01:15 --> 01:19] Episode 90, the 100th episode.
[01:19 --> 01:24] So here we are at a nice shiny milestone, cut and stamped, fittingly enough, during
[01:24 --> 01:30] the age of Antoninus Pius, who cut and stamped so many milestones during his reign.
[01:30 --> 01:34] I never thought when I started the show that I would ever get near 100 episodes, nor did
[01:34 --> 01:38] I think for a minute I would still be doing this almost 3 years after I published the
[01:38 --> 01:43] first episode on a random Sunday night in late July 2007.
[01:43 --> 01:50] That first episode was just over 1900 words and lasted 11 minutes and 48 seconds.
[01:50 --> 01:54] After I got a few episodes of similar length under my belt, I did some loose math about
[01:54 --> 01:58] how much progress I was making each week so I could figure out what kind of hole I had
[01:58 --> 02:00] dug myself into.
[02:00 --> 02:02] The results seemed crazy.
[02:02 --> 02:09] To complete the whole course of the empire would take 225-250,000 words and wind up being
[02:09 --> 02:14] 20 hours of recorded material spread out over maybe 75 episodes.
[02:14 --> 02:19] In other words, I was committing myself to producing a gargantuan pile of words.
[02:19 --> 02:24] I tried not to think about it and went back to researching the plebeian secession of 494
[02:24 --> 02:25] BC.
[02:25 --> 02:27] Fast forward to today.
[02:27 --> 02:36] 99 episodes in the can, working on the 100th as we speak, 329,186 words and counting.
[02:36 --> 02:42] The album I maintain in iTunes is now calculated in terms of days rather than hours, and we're
[02:42 --> 02:45] not even to Marcus Aurelius yet.
[02:45 --> 02:48] So how long is the history of Rome going to take to complete?
[02:48 --> 02:49] The answer?
[02:49 --> 02:50] I have no idea.
[02:50 --> 02:53] I don't make projections anymore.
[02:53 --> 02:59] Last week's tour of the empire was an absurd 6400 words and lasted 43 minutes and 43 seconds.
[02:59 --> 03:01] Who saw that coming?
[03:01 --> 03:02] Certainly not me.
[03:02 --> 03:06] It'll be done when it's done and not a minute before.
[03:06 --> 03:11] Of course, as you know, today we're going to continue to make no forward progress and
[03:11 --> 03:16] instead celebrate the occasion of the 100th episode by opening the floor up to questions.
[03:16 --> 03:21] Obviously, I'm not going to be able to answer every question that came in, but there were
[03:21 --> 03:25] definitely a couple of topics that seemed to be on more than one person's mind.
[03:25 --> 03:30] I'll do my best to cover those and then tuck in a few more I liked particularly or that
[03:30 --> 03:33] allowed me to talk about things I missed along the way.
[03:33 --> 03:37] In cases where more than one person asked essentially the same question, I'm going to
[03:37 --> 03:43] name the first person who posted, which seemed a fair and judicious way of doing things.
[03:43 --> 03:46] So without further ado, let's get started.
[03:46 --> 03:55] Nemo, among many others, asked, who are the five best emperors and who are the five worst?
[03:55 --> 03:59] I initially had a sort of rambling explanation for how we ought to be judging these guys
[03:59 --> 04:03] and what terms like best and worst mean to me.
[04:03 --> 04:07] But then I realized that if I went on like that, I'd only have time to answer like three
[04:07 --> 04:08] questions.
[04:08 --> 04:12] So, in the interest of maximizing the number of questions I'm going to be able to get to,
[04:12 --> 04:15] I'm just going to cut to the chase.
[04:15 --> 04:18] Number one, Augustus, for obvious reasons.
[04:18 --> 04:24] Number two, Diocletian, for almost single-handedly reviving and rejuvenating a broken empire,
[04:24 --> 04:27] even if it did all start to fall apart after he died.
[04:27 --> 04:33] Three, Trajan, for his stabilizing hand, good-natured wisdom, and military skill.
[04:33 --> 04:38] Four, Constantine, for, among other things, his lasting impact.
[04:38 --> 04:41] I mean, Constantinople.
[04:41 --> 04:47] Five, Hadrian, for his obsession with cementing the Roman Empire as a permanent institution
[04:47 --> 04:52] guided by pragmatism rather than romantic notions of glory.
[04:52 --> 04:56] I'm as surprised as you are that Marcus Aurelius is not on that list.
[04:56 --> 04:58] He's probably number six.
[04:58 --> 05:00] Vespasian is probably number seven.
[05:00 --> 05:02] After that, I'm not really sure.
[05:02 --> 05:05] I think I'd plug Claudius in at ten.
[05:05 --> 05:08] Aurelian was pretty awesome, even if he didn't rule for very long.
[05:08 --> 05:11] Theodosius should probably be in there too.
[05:11 --> 05:15] They'll admit that at this point, he's one of the major emperors I know the least about,
[05:15 --> 05:19] having always focused on early Roman history rather than late Roman history.
[05:19 --> 05:23] Which, for those of you who asked what my favorite period in Roman history is, it's
[05:23 --> 05:28] pretty much everything between the exile of Tarquinius Superbus to the victory at Zama.
[05:28 --> 05:32] I'm an early and high Republican era kind of guy.
[05:32 --> 05:37] My five worst emperors, sort of not counting the guys whose reigns are measured in months
[05:37 --> 05:43] and days, are, number one, Commodus, for being a dangerously insane, immature hedonist.
[05:43 --> 05:48] Two, Caligula, also for being a dangerously insane, immature hedonist.
[05:48 --> 05:55] Three, Caracalla, for being a relatively sane, but still unquestionably bloodthirsty tyrant.
[05:55 --> 06:00] Four, Nero, for being an immature hedonist, who was more concerned with performance than
[06:00 --> 06:02] he was with governance.
[06:02 --> 06:07] And five, Elagobulus, for being such a damn weirdo that no one knew what to do with him
[06:07 --> 06:10] until they finally decided it was best to just kill him.
[06:10 --> 06:14] Which was probably for the best.
[06:14 --> 06:18] The one common theme I see running through this list is too much power at too young an
[06:18 --> 06:19] age.
[06:19 --> 06:23] Caligula, believe it or not, was the most seasoned member of this group, coming to power
[06:23 --> 06:26] at the advanced age of 24.
[06:26 --> 06:30] Not that there aren't worthy exceptions, but I think in general we should always remember
[06:30 --> 06:36] that handing absolute power to a teenager is just a bad idea.
[06:36 --> 06:41] A follow up to this question was submitted by Monique, given all the emperors and Roman
[06:41 --> 06:45] leaders you've covered, who interests you the most, and why.
[06:45 --> 06:50] Continuing with the emperors first, I am now very fond of both Claudius and Domitian,
[06:50 --> 06:54] because they were the two leaders who turned out to be the most different from my initial
[06:54 --> 06:59] impressions of them, Claudius the dullard and Domitian the tyrant.
[06:59 --> 07:04] Both had their faults, but both were also far more complex and effective than I had
[07:04 --> 07:06] given them credit for.
[07:06 --> 07:11] Besides them, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Marcus Furius Camillus, who
[07:11 --> 07:16] was once a towering figure in Roman history, and has now basically been forgotten.
[07:16 --> 07:22] Scipio Africanus of course, that damned long hair who beat Hannibal, and finally dear old
[07:22 --> 07:24] Marcus Agrippa.
[07:24 --> 07:30] We should all hope to have best friends as utterly kick ass as Marcus Agrippa.
[07:30 --> 07:34] Touching on a subject that popped up a few times, Lycanthrope asks, one of the earliest
[07:34 --> 07:39] topics that was brought up is the purported similarities between Ancient Rome and the
[07:39 --> 07:40] US.
[07:40 --> 07:45] What are the main similarities and differences between Ancient Rome and the present and historical
[07:45 --> 07:46] US?
[07:46 --> 07:50] Well, let's go through the obvious list.
[07:50 --> 07:55] The United States, kicked out a monarch, founded a republic wildly skewed in favor of a rich
[07:55 --> 08:01] aristocracy that was self-consciously modeled on Roman institutions, dealt with violent upheavals
[08:01 --> 08:07] as the lower social classes attempted to capture some power for themselves, expanded
[08:07 --> 08:12] aggressively on their own continent before accidentally capturing overseas territories,
[08:12 --> 08:17] now utterly dominant militarily, politically, and economically.
[08:17 --> 08:19] What else do you need to know?
[08:19 --> 08:23] Throw in the fact that if you believe the Soviet Union was Carthage and that the Cold
[08:23 --> 08:28] War is our equivalent of the Punic Wars, then you can even locate us within the larger timeline
[08:28 --> 08:34] right around the rise of the Grokai brothers and, hey look, tea parties.
[08:34 --> 08:38] Except that one thing that's really been driven home to me lately is that while you can find
[08:38 --> 08:42] these superficial similarities, there are much deeper differences.
[08:42 --> 08:47] Every powerful nation follows its own trajectory for its own particular reasons towards its
[08:47 --> 08:52] own particular ends, though usually at the height of each one's power they claim that
[08:52 --> 08:56] they are the rebirth of the Roman Empire.
[08:56 --> 09:01] For me, the biggest difference between America and Rome is that compared to Rome, the United
[09:01 --> 09:07] States is a baby, and could very well prove to be merely a flash in the pan.
[09:07 --> 09:12] The Roman Empire became the dominant state in the Mediterranean around 200 BC, and remained
[09:12 --> 09:16] as such in one form or another until the fall of Constantinople in the 1450s.
[09:16 --> 09:22] I mean, we are talking about a nearly 2000 year period where you simply cannot talk about
[09:22 --> 09:28] anything that occurred in North Africa, Europe, or the Middle East without talking about Rome.
[09:28 --> 09:33] America, by contrast, was a pretty decent regional power for about a century, a pretty
[09:33 --> 09:39] major world power for about 75 years after that, and has been living with the kind of
[09:39 --> 09:44] unipolar prestige Rome enjoyed for centuries for about the last 20 years.
[09:44 --> 09:49] If the United States of America is still around in 3010, I think maybe then we can start talking
[09:49 --> 09:52] about comparisons to Rome.
[09:52 --> 09:56] Until then, things happen, nations rise and fall, and borders shift.
[09:56 --> 10:00] I'm not saying America can't dominate the world for a millennia, I'm just saying that
[10:00 --> 10:04] it's an awful lot to ask of anyone.
[10:04 --> 10:09] Rome was all about longevity and stability, and that is a test that no one in the West
[10:09 --> 10:13] has been able to pass since.
[10:13 --> 10:18] Alfonso was one of the first to raise the issue of Roman dealings abroad, and the first
[10:18 --> 10:24] to mention the Far East, a particular topic that was seconded at least a half dozen times.
[10:24 --> 10:29] So, to paraphrase all of those questions, what, if any, relationship existed between
[10:29 --> 10:33] Rome and China?
[10:33 --> 10:38] The majority of the contact between Rome and China was indirect, but the two great bookends
[10:38 --> 10:41] of the world certainly knew that the other existed.
[10:41 --> 10:47] The Han dynasty, which persisted in one form or another from about 200 BC to 220 AD, was
[10:47 --> 10:53] rising at the same time as the Romans, and as Rome headed east, the Han headed west,
[10:53 --> 10:57] and it was during this period that the links became more overt.
[10:57 --> 11:02] With the stabilizing hand of the Han in place, the famous Silk Road was able to knit itself
[11:02 --> 11:08] together, carrying silk and other oriental treasures from China all the way to Antioch
[11:08 --> 11:13] and from there to Rome, while, among other things, Roman glasswork made their way back
[11:13 --> 11:15] to the Chinese.
[11:15 --> 11:20] In 97 AD, a Chinese embassy was sent west to try to make contact with the Kingdom of
[11:20 --> 11:25] the Da Qin, which is what the Han called Rome, but apparently they were stopped short
[11:25 --> 11:30] in Mesopotamia after the Parthians explained that the difficult crossing to Rome would
[11:30 --> 11:32] take another two years at least.
[11:32 --> 11:37] This bald-faced lie was meant to keep the two poles of the lucrative trade routes, which
[11:37 --> 11:43] Parthia controlled, from ever meeting and working out a way to bypass the Parthian middlemen.
[11:43 --> 11:48] In 166 though, a Roman embassy was sent east and was able to make contact with the Chinese
[11:48 --> 11:50] Emperor.
[11:50 --> 11:55] Debate still swirls about how the Romans got there, whether by sea or overland, but a meeting
[11:55 --> 11:59] definitely occurred and the Romans offered up all kinds of gifts from the west, including
[11:59 --> 12:02] a book of Greco-Roman astronomy.
[12:02 --> 12:07] Nothing concrete seems to have followed the meeting though, and thereafter, the two sides
[12:07 --> 12:11] continued to simply trade with one another indirectly via the Silk Road or by the sea
[12:11 --> 12:13] routes around India.
[12:13 --> 12:17] For the remainder of the empire, Chinese silk remained a highly sought after luxury item
[12:17 --> 12:23] in Rome and was a major point of contention both for old school conservatives who found
[12:23 --> 12:28] how revealing the fabric was disturbing, and proto-economists who worried about how much
[12:28 --> 12:34] gold was disappearing east for nothing but a few scraps of cloth.
[12:34 --> 12:40] Matthew, if I'm even pronouncing that correctly, riffing off my observation that the Romans
[12:40 --> 12:44] tangled up Pyrrhus' war elephants the same way that the Rebel Alliance brought down
[12:44 --> 12:49] the Imperial Walkers during the Battle of Hoth, asks, did the Republicans or Imperial
[12:49 --> 12:54] armies learn any other tactics from the rebellion?
[12:54 --> 12:56] Short answer, no, I don't think so.
[12:56 --> 13:01] But I can absolutely promise you that a single Roman legion would have whipped the Ewoks
[13:01 --> 13:05] without breaking a sweat.
[13:06 --> 13:11] among others, wants to know about the show's process, how the podcast is put together,
[13:11 --> 13:15] how long it takes to write and record each episode.
[13:15 --> 13:21] Each show takes about 10-12 hours to knock out, not counting the time I spend just reading,
[13:21 --> 13:25] which is time I don't bother to calculate since I'd be doing it anyway.
[13:25 --> 13:29] My days off have become very jumbled lately, so my research writing hours are constantly
[13:29 --> 13:34] shifting around, but for a long time, the routine was that I would spend an hour or
[13:34 --> 13:38] two during the week working up a detailed outline of what I wanted to talk about and
[13:38 --> 13:40] where I wanted to get to.
[13:40 --> 13:45] Then I would get up on Saturday and write for maybe 6 or 7 hours and try to bank about
[13:45 --> 13:47] 3,000 words.
[13:47 --> 13:51] Then I'd get up on Sunday, edit what I had written the day before, and write the last
[13:51 --> 13:54] 500 to 1,000 words to wrap things up.
[13:54 --> 13:59] Then I'd let it all rest, go back and edit again, double check whatever facts I wasn't
[13:59 --> 14:03] 100% on, and read through it aloud to catch any tongue twister landmines that I had left
[14:03 --> 14:06] for myself.
[14:06 --> 14:10] Then recording 20 minutes of material takes about another hour, depending on how in the
[14:10 --> 14:11] zone I am.
[14:11 --> 14:16] For this, I run two parallel vocal tracks in GarageBand, and when I stumble over something,
[14:16 --> 14:22] I cut out the last few seconds, hop to the other track, and pick up where I left off.
[14:22 --> 14:26] When I'm done, I convert it into an mp3, upload it to the hosting site, and release
[14:26 --> 14:28] it into the world.
[14:28 --> 14:32] Then I have a beer, congratulate myself on a job well done, and begin fretting about
[14:32 --> 14:36] next week's show.
[14:36 --> 14:41] John Grandin wants to know, at the 100th episode of the History of Rome Games, who wins the
[14:41 --> 14:42] following fights?
[14:42 --> 14:43] 1.
[14:43 --> 14:48] Sekhitor vs. Ritariaris, which are two kinds of gladiator styles.
[14:48 --> 14:49] 2.
[14:49 --> 14:50] Nero vs. Commodus.
[14:50 --> 14:51] 3.
[14:51 --> 14:53] Cleopatra vs. Messalina.
[14:53 --> 14:54] 4.
[14:54 --> 14:56] Kirk Douglas vs. Russell Crowe.
[14:56 --> 14:57] 5.
[14:57 --> 15:00] England vs. United States in the World Cup.
[15:00 --> 15:05] First, it seemed like the Sekhitor would be usually favored, but a talented Ritari was
[15:05 --> 15:07] nothing to mess around with.
[15:07 --> 15:11] Plus, he'll make you look like a fool when he beats you, so draw.
[15:11 --> 15:12] 2.
[15:12 --> 15:14] Commodus for sure.
[15:14 --> 15:18] By all accounts, he was an excellent shot and a well-trained gladiator, even if he never
[15:18 --> 15:20] really tested his skills in a fair fight.
[15:20 --> 15:23] Nero wouldn't stand a chance.
[15:23 --> 15:24] 3.
[15:24 --> 15:25] Cleopatra.
[15:25 --> 15:29] Messalina was a bumbling amateur compared to Cleopatra.
[15:29 --> 15:30] 4.
[15:31 --> 15:32] Sadly, I have to go with Russell Crowe.
[15:32 --> 15:35] I mean, Kirk Douglas is like 94 years old.
[15:35 --> 15:36] 5.
[15:36 --> 15:43] The United States, because who says I can't be irrationally partisan about some things?
[15:43 --> 15:47] George Smiley asks, Here's a frivolous, non-historical question.
[15:47 --> 15:50] Where does the theme music for The History of Rome come from?
[15:50 --> 15:53] Is that mic on guitar?
[15:53 --> 15:56] The intro is one of those accidents of history.
[15:56 --> 16:00] First of all, it's not me playing, though if I had to do it all over again, I would
[16:00 --> 16:05] definitely write and record the music myself, as I am, quite proudly, an accomplished mediocrity
[16:05 --> 16:07] on the guitar.
[16:07 --> 16:11] Basically, when I was cutting the first episode, I knew I wanted to inject some music at the
[16:11 --> 16:16] beginning of the show, so I dug around in the garage band loops until I found something
[16:16 --> 16:19] I kinda liked, and pasted it in there.
[16:19 --> 16:23] Then I released the episode without ever considering what kind of commitment I was making to that
[16:23 --> 16:28] one particular loop, which I still like just fine, it's just, yeah, it's a freaking garage
[16:28 --> 16:33] band loop, acoustic picking 18 for you Mac users out there.
[16:33 --> 16:38] At least it's not 80s dance bass synth 6.
[16:38 --> 16:43] Bob Tom asks, Will Mrs. The History of Rome ever make an appearance?
[16:43 --> 16:47] Yes, and she just did.
[16:47 --> 16:53] Ryan Reyes, among others, particularly Ryan R. 313, was wondering about making the dead
[16:53 --> 16:55] emperors gods.
[16:55 --> 16:57] Were they seen as gods equal to Saturn and the others?
[16:57 --> 16:59] How did that work?
[16:59 --> 17:04] The old Greco-Roman pantheon had literally hundreds of major and minor deities who all
[17:04 --> 17:07] vied for the attention of the lowly humans.
[17:07 --> 17:13] The dead and deified emperors, beginning with Julius Caesar, were slated in as minor gods,
[17:13 --> 17:18] nowhere near as powerful as Jupiter or Mars, but still important enough that worshipping
[17:18 --> 17:22] at their altars was considered a civic duty.
[17:22 --> 17:27] Neglecting sacrifices or ceremonies in their honor would have invited disaster on Rome,
[17:27 --> 17:32] as the imperial cult became wrapped up in the larger set of official state superstitions
[17:32 --> 17:35] that kept the empire safe and thriving.
[17:35 --> 17:40] In practice, though, worshipping dead emperors was less an act of devout piety or even crass
[17:41 --> 17:45] as it was a demonstration of loyalty to the sitting emperor.
[17:45 --> 17:50] It was all much more about visibly supplicating yourself before the imperial altar, which
[17:50 --> 17:55] the emperors, as you can imagine, like to see, than really believing that if you didn't
[17:55 --> 17:59] offer a goat to the ghost of Titus, that bad things would happen.
[17:59 --> 18:01] Not that you really had a choice anyway.
[18:01 --> 18:06] Refusing to make a sacrifice to the deified Caesars was considered treason and a capital
[18:06 --> 18:07] crime.
[18:07 --> 18:12] So yes, technically, the dead emperors were considered gods, especially in the Eastern
[18:12 --> 18:17] Empire, where notions of divine monarchs has a long-standing history.
[18:17 --> 18:21] I highly doubt, however, that a single senator voting for deification believed that Nerva
[18:21 --> 18:26] was now actually a god.
[18:26 --> 18:32] Keith Day asks, if you could sum up the Romans in three words, what would they be?
[18:32 --> 18:39] I think the only reasonable answer is Vinni Vidi Vici, right?
[18:39 --> 18:45] Scott Debrucker, among others, asks, I thought a pivotal event in history was the burning
[18:45 --> 18:49] of the Library of Alexandria, an event thought to have set human progress back a thousand
[18:49 --> 18:50] years.
[18:50 --> 18:55] I was astonished when it was not even referenced in a past episode.
[18:55 --> 19:00] Yes, the absence of the Library of Alexandria from our narrative was an oversight on my
[19:00 --> 19:05] part, especially since Julius Caesar himself is accused of having started the fire that
[19:05 --> 19:10] allegedly set humanity back a thousand years.
[19:10 --> 19:15] For those of you who don't know, the Library of Alexandria was founded in the 200s BC by
[19:15 --> 19:21] either Ptolemy I or Ptolemy II, and thereafter was liberally endowed to not only act as the
[19:21 --> 19:26] repository for every written work that had ever been written anywhere, but also as an
[19:26 --> 19:30] active research institution that employed around a hundred scholars and scientists at
[19:30 --> 19:32] any given time.
[19:32 --> 19:37] Supposedly, the Library contained a working steam engine, so its destruction came as a
[19:37 --> 19:41] huge blow to human development.
[19:41 --> 19:45] But the thing is, is that the jury is still out on when the Library was actually destroyed,
[19:45 --> 19:47] and who destroyed it.
[19:47 --> 19:51] Some, like Plutarch, say that it was Caesar who torched it by accident while fighting
[19:51 --> 19:54] for control of the city in 49 BC.
[19:54 --> 19:59] Others say it was destroyed by Aurelian in the 270s when he was reconquering the breakaway
[19:59 --> 20:00] east.
[20:00 --> 20:05] Gibbon said it was destroyed by the reactionary Christian patriarch Theophilus during his
[20:05 --> 20:10] crusade to eradicate all things pagan in the late 300s, while finally, some say that the
[20:10 --> 20:15] Library existed all the way into the 600s when it was finally burned by Umar the Great
[20:15 --> 20:19] as his Islamic forces swept into Egypt.
[20:19 --> 20:25] Unquestionably, the Library existed, and unquestionably, at some point, it stopped existing.
[20:25 --> 20:29] But when that happened is still a bit of a mystery.
[20:29 --> 20:34] I tend to believe that multiple institutions and collections were built, maintained, destroyed
[20:34 --> 20:39] and rebuilt over the years that all held the moniker Library of Alexandria, which contributes
[20:39 --> 20:41] a great deal to the confusion.
[20:41 --> 20:46] Clearly, though, Plutarch believes that the Great Library was gone by the time he was
[20:46 --> 20:52] writing in 120, and as a Greek scholar, he would have been in a position to know.
[20:52 --> 20:56] Absent a time machine, I don't think we'll ever know what really happened or what exactly
[20:56 --> 20:58] was lost.
[20:58 --> 21:02] What we do know is that had the Library survived, we'd all be teleporting to our jobs in the
[21:02 --> 21:07] parallel universe of our choice by now.
[21:07 --> 21:11] Rich asks, Do you plan to combine your transcripts and sell them as a book when all is said and
[21:11 --> 21:13] done?
[21:13 --> 21:15] The answer is a qualified yes.
[21:15 --> 21:20] I've been very hesitant about trying to publish the material as it is, because I wrote it
[21:20 --> 21:22] specifically to be read aloud.
[21:22 --> 21:23] By me.
[21:23 --> 21:27] I was and am worried that it will translate about as well as your average stand-up comedy
[21:27 --> 21:29] routine would.
[21:29 --> 21:33] When something is specifically designed to be spoken, and depends on particular timing
[21:33 --> 21:37] and inflection for the jokes to come out right, well, reading it on paper just doesn't do
[21:37 --> 21:40] it justice, you know?
[21:40 --> 21:44] But then again, with a little expert tweaking, maybe we could figure out a way to make it
[21:44 --> 21:45] work.
[21:45 --> 21:49] I've been so busy writing new material, though, that I haven't had much of a chance to go
[21:49 --> 21:52] back and try to make sense of the old stuff.
[21:52 --> 21:56] So if anyone out there works in publishing, by all means, get in touch with me and help
[21:56 --> 21:59] me out.
[21:59 --> 22:06] John asks, Which Roman Emperor Consul Triumvir do you think you personally emulate the most?
[22:06 --> 22:12] Well, Claudius wrote a lot of history, so there's that.
[22:12 --> 22:17] Dan Lim, among many, many others, asks, Personally, I'd like to know your thoughts on the HBO
[22:17 --> 22:19] series Rome.
[22:19 --> 22:20] Accurate?
[22:20 --> 22:22] Sensational?
[22:22 --> 22:26] Lots of people wanted to know about the historical accuracy of all the various portrayals of
[22:26 --> 22:29] Rome on TV and in the movies.
[22:29 --> 22:35] Gladiator, Spartacus, I, Claudius, HBO's Rome, and the new Spartacus series.
[22:35 --> 22:39] I'll start right off by saying that I'm not really a big stickler for details when it
[22:39 --> 22:40] comes to these things.
[22:40 --> 22:45] I can and do separate the fictional reality from the historical reality.
[22:45 --> 22:48] Did Livia poison everyone who got in her way?
[22:48 --> 22:49] Probably not.
[22:49 --> 22:54] Was there ever a Spanish general named Maximus who became a gladiator, killed Commodus, and
[22:54 --> 22:55] restored the Republic?
[22:55 --> 22:57] Of course not.
[22:57 --> 23:00] Was everyone in ancient Rome as handsome and clean as the original Spartacus would have
[23:00 --> 23:02] us believe?
[23:02 --> 23:03] Definitely not.
[23:03 --> 23:06] But none of that stuff really bothers me too much.
[23:06 --> 23:09] It's all fantasy and should be taken as such.
[23:09 --> 23:14] I'll admit to being on guard a lot more for the HBO series than I have been for others,
[23:14 --> 23:19] because they seem to be explicitly portraying major historical events that we know a lot
[23:19 --> 23:24] about, unlike say Spartacus, about whom we know almost nothing.
[23:24 --> 23:28] I thought Rome was excellent in places, and historically speaking, about as accurate as
[23:28 --> 23:31] the format allows.
[23:31 --> 23:35] Key characters were admitted sure, battles like Durakium were skipped completely, and
[23:35 --> 23:40] the whole second season compressed the timeline radically because the show was slated for
[23:40 --> 23:42] cancellation.
[23:42 --> 23:46] But history is really long and really complicated, and when you fictionalize it, you do have
[23:46 --> 23:51] to streamline things a bit, which I fully understand and sympathize with.
[23:51 --> 23:56] They did a bang up job though immersing me in the period, and by all accounts, the costumes,
[23:56 --> 24:01] uniforms and architecture are all spot on.
[24:01 --> 24:05] My only real complaints about Rome is that I found Lucius Verinus thoroughly detestable
[24:05 --> 24:10] as a character, even though I was supposed to like him, and a few of Titus Polo's storylines
[24:10 --> 24:12] were just terribly written.
[24:12 --> 24:18] But that has nothing to do with accuracy or authenticity, it was just bad writing.
[24:18 --> 24:23] I have the same problem with Spartacus Blood and Sand, the new ultra-violent sexploitation
[24:23 --> 24:27] show on Starz, also available to stream on Netflix.
[24:27 --> 24:31] I don't mind that it takes all the most sensationalist rumors about ancient Rome and cranks them up
[24:31 --> 24:34] to 11, that's all in good fun.
[24:34 --> 24:38] But the character of Spartacus is just developing in a way that leaves me really doubting his
[24:38 --> 24:43] ability to lead the greatest slave uprising in Roman history.
[24:43 --> 24:48] One in which, through a mix of personal charisma, strategic brilliance and tactical know-how,
[24:48 --> 24:52] he keeps the cream of the Roman legions on the ropes for two years.
[24:52 --> 24:57] The Spartacus we get here is selfish, weak and about as strategically minded as a water
[24:57 --> 25:00] buffalo in heat.
[25:00 --> 25:04] I have hopes that the rioters will let him grow up a bit, but if not, I think they ought
[25:04 --> 25:09] to crucify him and write an alternative history where Doctorae leads the great slave uprising.
[25:09 --> 25:14] That I would not only watch, but would believe.
[25:14 --> 25:18] For those of you who are curious, though, in my opinion, the most historically accurate
[25:18 --> 25:24] movie set in Rome has to be the little-known 1964 classic Rome vs. Rome, starring John
[25:24 --> 25:25] Drew Barrymore.
[25:25 --> 25:28] They should show this movie in schools as a documentary.
[25:28 --> 25:32] I am totally 100% serious about this.
[25:32 --> 25:38] Mal says, My question is what do you plan to do after the history of Rome?
[25:38 --> 25:43] Are there other periods or civilizations that also have your interest?
[25:43 --> 25:47] Well, right now I'm convinced that the history of Rome will never end, so I don't really
[25:47 --> 25:49] have to think about it.
[25:49 --> 25:54] But seriously, I am as passionate about American history as I am about Roman history, and have
[25:54 --> 25:59] had for a while now a particular project in mind that documents the life cycle of each
[25:59 --> 26:06] of the so far six distinct political party systems that have defined American history.
[26:06 --> 26:11] You know, first the Federalists vs. the Democratic Republicans, then the Jacksonian Democrats
[26:11 --> 26:17] vs. the Whigs, then the Republicans vs. the Reconstructed Democrats, and so on.
[26:17 --> 26:21] It winds up being a really great window into the larger cultural and economic history of
[26:21 --> 26:28] the country, and I'm really looking forward to turning it into something, someday.
[26:28 --> 26:34] 10-year-old Giants fangirl writes, Hi, being a huge baseball fan, here is a baseball question.
[26:34 --> 26:37] Who do you think should retire Randy Johnson's number?
[26:37 --> 26:41] I know you are a huge fan of him, as am I, and am curious.
[26:41 --> 26:45] Though he pitched with and made his name with the Diamondbacks, he was not too happy with
[26:45 --> 26:47] them for not signing him this last season.
[26:47 --> 26:52] So should the Giants retire his number instead?
[26:52 --> 26:56] First of all, I would like to gently remind those too young to remember that Randy Johnson
[26:56 --> 27:00] made his name with the Seattle Mariners, not the Arizona Diamondbacks.
[27:00 --> 27:05] His years in Arizona were brilliant, of course, but it was with Seattle that he first established
[27:05 --> 27:09] himself as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers of all time.
[27:09 --> 27:13] My answer, then, would normally be that both the Mariners and Diamondbacks ought to retire
[27:13 --> 27:18] his number, as there is nothing wrong with two teams honoring a player they both shared.
[27:18 --> 27:24] However, things are complicated a bit because Randy's number 51 is currently being sported
[27:24 --> 27:29] by future Hall of Famer and possible minor deity Ichiro Suzuki.
[27:29 --> 27:34] So my final answer is that the Diamondbacks ought to retire his number, and the Mariners
[27:34 --> 27:40] ought to just issue it to every player on the team, since clearly it has magical properties.
[27:40 --> 27:45] A Fisher submits, I think the only time that archers were ever mentioned in any of the
[27:45 --> 27:50] episodes is when the Romans were fighting the mounted archers of the Numidian cavalry.
[27:50 --> 27:56] The maps of battles also contained the infantry and the cavalry, but never the archers.
[27:56 --> 27:58] It always seemed to be a serious tactical mistake.
[27:58 --> 28:01] Did the Romans simply not employ them?
[28:01 --> 28:05] Were their tactics not compatible with archers, or were archers included with either the cavalry
[28:05 --> 28:09] or the infantry, but not as a separate unit?
[28:09 --> 28:14] The Romans did use archers, but they were almost always foreign auxiliary units brought
[28:14 --> 28:16] in from the east.
[28:16 --> 28:19] Whether on foot or mounted, they would have generally been used at the beginning of a
[28:19 --> 28:24] battle to create chaos within the enemy ranks and dampen an opponent's morale.
[28:24 --> 28:29] The Romans also employed slingers to accomplish the same goal.
[28:29 --> 28:33] But it was all about softening up the other line for a good old heavy infantry attack,
[28:33 --> 28:39] rather than as a primary offensive weapon, as with say the Parthians and, most famously,
[28:39 --> 28:40] the Mongols.
[28:40 --> 28:45] Whether this was a tactical error is debatable, as the record of the legions pretty much speaks
[28:45 --> 28:47] for itself.
[28:47 --> 28:52] Christina asks, when did Latin officially die as a language?
[28:52 --> 28:56] Do we have any record of who the last native speaker of Latin was?
[28:56 --> 29:01] Well, Latin never really died, it just went underground.
[29:01 --> 29:06] At some point around the 9th century, Vulgar Latin, which had become the predominant spoken
[29:06 --> 29:11] language for most of the lower class citizens of the now fallen empire, began to splinter
[29:11 --> 29:17] into the various Romance languages we know today – French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian,
[29:17 --> 29:18] etc.
[29:18 --> 29:23] Latin in its written form, meanwhile, survived this oral transition in the pages of the Catholic
[29:23 --> 29:28] Church and the law books of the various European kingdoms, though its unmooring from a spoken
[29:28 --> 29:33] counterpoint has rendered it a very different animal than the Romans knew.
[29:33 --> 29:37] So I think the answer is basically, Latin was dead by the time of Charlemagne.
[29:37 --> 29:44] But if you look around, you'll notice that Latin continues to surround us today.
[29:44 --> 29:48] Nick asks, time is of course an illusion, but I think it might be interesting to investigate
[29:48 --> 29:54] the Roman calendar and clock, which I understand had variable hours which appear on Prague's
[29:54 --> 29:57] famous clock.
[29:57 --> 30:00] I'm glad this was asked because it was something that I wanted to talk about during a day in
[30:00 --> 30:04] the life, but the narrative thread just never gave me a good opportunity to stick it in
[30:04 --> 30:06] there.
[30:06 --> 30:13] For most of the early republic, the day was divided roughly into before noon and afternoon.
[30:13 --> 30:18] The Romans did not adopt accurate sundials and water clocks until the 2nd century BC,
[30:18 --> 30:23] and even then, they were more of a novelty or decorative piece than anything else.
[30:23 --> 30:28] In essence, the Romans were just not locked into minutes and hours the way that we are.
[30:28 --> 30:33] Punctuality was never stressed, and except for the large markers like sunrise, noon,
[30:33 --> 30:40] and sunset, they paid very little attention to what quote unquote time it was.
[30:40 --> 30:44] In the first few centuries AD, this began to change somewhat as accurate Greek time
[30:44 --> 30:48] pieces began to be adopted in a much more serious manner.
[30:48 --> 30:52] At that point, people did begin to pay more attention to the division of hours that had
[30:52 --> 30:57] been named and assigned way back when sundials first began to appear around the time of the
[30:57 --> 30:59] Punic Wars.
[30:59 --> 31:05] The Roman day was divided as hours into 24 hours, 12 day time, and 12 night time.
[31:05 --> 31:09] But the fascinating thing is that, because of the shifting seasons, Roman hours were
[31:09 --> 31:11] forever variable.
[31:11 --> 31:14] The Roman hour was not a set 60 minutes.
[31:14 --> 31:19] It was instead simply 1 12th of however long the day was.
[31:19 --> 31:23] This meant that during the winter solstice, a Roman daylight hour was only 45 minutes
[31:23 --> 31:28] long, while during the summer solstice, it was extended to an hour and 15 minutes.
[31:28 --> 31:33] So over the course of the year, there was a 30 minute swing in how long an hour actually
[31:33 --> 31:34] was.
[31:34 --> 31:38] And you think daylight savings time is weird.
[31:38 --> 31:43] My understanding is that the clock in Prague uses a variation of Italian hours, where the
[31:43 --> 31:48] first hour begins whenever the sun sets, and the 24th hour immediately precedes the next
[31:48 --> 31:49] sunset.
[31:49 --> 31:55] Obviously, this means that as with Roman hours, when say the 7th hour or the 19th hour starts
[31:55 --> 31:57] and ends, varies with the season.
[31:58 --> 32:02] But the Roman system was all about fluctuating lengths of time, rather than changing start
[32:02 --> 32:04] times.
[32:04 --> 32:09] Finally, Detlef asks, if you were to start all over again with the experience you have
[32:09 --> 32:14] today, what would you do differently, not including correcting minor mistakes and fixing
[32:14 --> 32:17] minor glitches?
[32:17 --> 32:21] I have one answer to this question that revolves around the narrative, and another that is
[32:21 --> 32:26] a technical point that would have done a lot to resolve the minor mistakes.
[32:26 --> 32:30] To take the latter first, I would have given myself a much firmer grounding in Latin before
[32:30 --> 32:36] I got started, so that I wasn't constantly undermining myself with butchered pronunciation.
[32:36 --> 32:41] As to the former, I think as we shifted from the Republic to the Empire, the show really
[32:41 --> 32:46] did begin to focus too intently on the emperors at the expense of other worthy topics.
[32:46 --> 32:51] I can mount a pretty good defense of why I chose to go in the direction I did, but mostly,
[32:51 --> 32:54] I'm just going to try to do a better job in the future, making sure the history of
[32:54 --> 33:00] Rome is the history of Rome, not the history of the Roman emperors.
[33:00 --> 33:05] Well, okay, I think I've crammed in about as much as I can.
[33:05 --> 33:09] There are tons of questions that I wanted to get to, but simply did not have the time
[33:09 --> 33:10] to cover.
[33:10 --> 33:14] If your question didn't get answered, don't despair, I read every comment that came in
[33:14 --> 33:18] and have them all banked away in my History of Rome folder and plan to dip into them from
[33:18 --> 33:22] time to time as we continue along our way.
[33:22 --> 33:26] At a minimum, all the great feedback let me know what kinds of things you all are interested
[33:26 --> 33:27] in.
[33:27 --> 33:32] So, even if I don't do another big question blowout, if I can find a way to steer the
[33:32 --> 33:36] narrative in a way that will let me cover things people asked about, I'm totally going
[33:36 --> 33:39] to do it.
[33:39 --> 33:44] Next week, though, we're back to basics, to cover the transition from Antoninus Pius
[33:44 --> 33:49] to Marcus Aurelius, the man who shows up on many top 5 emperors lists, and Lucius Verus,
[33:49 --> 33:54] a man who, if he's not careful, could very well find himself appearing on a list of the
[33:54 --> 33:57] worst emperors of all time.
